			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a575abdc970b-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> I don&#39;t know about you, but where we live, the cooler, earlier nights are making it feel like fall already. Getting the kids back to school while simultaneously starting soccer season has added so much structure to our days that it&#39;s a wonder how we&#39;ll have time for anything else: meals, homework, weekend get-aways, bike rides, gardening, the music and foreign language lessons I vowed to get my kids signed up for this year, let alone just good old unstructured outdoors playtime. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.nwf.org/beoutthere/">National Wildlife Federation</a> has a <a href="http://greenhour.org/content/blog/detail/8359/">great list of ways to &#39;Be Out There&#39; (even though we&#39;re all deep into back-to-school mode), and renew our commitment to the Green Hour</a>. Here in Portland, September tends to be lovely. So today I&#39;m hanging my wash on the line (while keeping my fingers crossed that the rain, rain stays away), yet wondering how many more weeks I&#39;ll get away with using the solar clothes dryer. The garden is still offering many edible delights, but mostly mocking me (two years running my attempts to cage a tomato plant have failed, and the stakes I used for my raspberry vines? I might have had better luck with toothpicks for all the good they are doing!). Both kids also have soccer practice later, so I know we&#39;ll get outside today. But most days, we are making sure the homework gets done after school, and it&#39;s easy to forget that the great outdoors is often our best playground. That&#39;s why the bikes, trikes, sidewalk chalk, home-made hula hoop and <a href="../../../../2009/07/precycle-diy-lemon-twist-with-items-from-the-reuse-center/">lemon twist </a>will remain outside with easy access for as long as the kids keep playing with them. </p><p>How important is the Green Hour to your family during the school year? Any special ways your kids like to spend their time outside? </p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a571a462970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="DSCN3297" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a571a462970b image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a571a462970b-800wi.jpg" title="DSCN3297"/></a> </p>
<p>Who&#39;s in?</p>
<p>OK, let me back up a sec. I recently read two stats that stuck in my brain:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>Industrial livestock creates 18 percent more greenhouse gases than cars. (UN Food & Agriculture Organization)</p>
<p>An estimated 70 percent of our nation&#39;s antibiotics are used in livestock feed. (Union of Concerned Scientists)</p></blockquote>
<p>Holy cow. (Literally.) Now, if you&#39;re like me, you try really hard to buy only drug-free, pasture-raised meat. While this is good, a scant percentage of the population is doing this. Small meat farmers could not produce enough meat to support the US population&#39;s consumption of it, which is why we all need to be eating less of it and knocking down the industrial meat industry. But I <em>still </em>think about meat first when I think about dinner. I&#39;m still stuck in the meat-centric meal plan. It&#39;s time to change that. Enter the EnviroMom Meatless Supper Club!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s our thought: We want to find 10 bloggers who will cook meatless dinners for their families once a week for&#0160;eight weeks. Each week you&#39;ll post your recipe on your blog, with photos.&#0160;Every Friday, Renee and I will post our own recipes and include descriptions and links to the 10 bloggers&#39; recipes. That way, we&#39;ll all have access to a bunch of family-tested recipes that we can try at home. <strong>The goal of the Meatless Supper Club is to get everyone preparing a meatless dinner at least once a week</strong> (and then bump it up to twice a week!). We want to create a library of recipes to pick and choose from, with photos and reviews from the bloggers&#39; kids. </p>
<p>Some ground rules for the bloggers: let&#39;s not go crazy on the dairy. Dairy can be present, but minimal. Same with eggs. Recipes should be geared to busy families with young-ish children -- so let&#39;s keep the ingredients accessible and not too numerous. We want to know what your kids think about it, and what you&#39;d do differently the next time to make it more palatable for them. </p>
<p>Now about&#0160;protein. How did we become so fixated on protein? The more I read, the more I realize that we&#39;re probably getting way more protein than we need. Plants (veggies, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts) are loaded with protein. As long as we&#39;re eating a diet primarily of whole foods, our protein needs are going to be met. So as we incorporate more meatless meals into our diets, let&#39;s not be so fixated on protein; let&#39;s be fixated on eating a variety of whole foods.</p>
<p>Renee and I are super amped about this idea, and&#0160;we&#39;re wondering if anyone else is, too. Are you guys ready for some meatless inspiration? Are you interested in being one of our recipe bloggers? Leave a comment and make sure to include your email in the form -- we&#39;ll be in touch! Or send us an email at enviromompdx [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>
<p>(FYI Portland, the <a href="http://www.nwveg.org/" target="_blank">VegFest</a> is this Saturday, Sept. 19 from 10am-8pm at the convention center.)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve posted about Legacy Health&#39;s local efforts to properly fit car seats and bike helmets, and also <a href="../../../../car_seats/">recycle those same car seats</a> and bike helmets when they expire. In our blasted down-turned economy, it&#39;s beyond fantastic that Legacy Health continues to offer this recycling service for free to Portland Metro families. </p><p>I&#39;ve written about this <a href="../../../../2008/05/critical-mass-f/">local car seat recycling program that ensures car seats are not being used past their prime</a>, as it&#39;s a little known fact that they do expire. What&#39;s often frustrating for those of us who like to reduce and reuse as much as possible is that there are precious few places in the United States that will recycle old car seats. Yet, thanks to Legacy Health we are blessed in Portland Metro to continue to have that option. </p><p>What&#39;s new is that they now ask families to <strong>strip from the car seats all fabric, webbing and soft foam </strong>(these parts are not recyclable) prior to bringing in the car seats for recycling. I hope this will not deter families from recycling the seats. I&#39;m often encouraged by the frequent comments and emails we receive about how others in the country would love to recycle their car seats if they had a local option. Sadly, not many places do and the consensus of comments is that it seems so lame to have to landfill the many seats most car-driving families go through while their kids are too small to safely ride without them.</p><p>Legacy Health is offering two events in the near future for car seat and bike helmet recycling:</p><ul>
<li>Saturday, September 19, 2009: 10am to 2pm as part of the <a href="http://www.legacyhealth.org/body.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&amp;id=13&amp;registration=true&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=31225">Healthy Kids Fair</a> at Legacy Mount Hood. The car seat recycling will be across the street from the main fair at Saturn East (3265 SW Sundial Ave.,
 Troutdale 97060). </li>
<li>Saturday, October 3, 2009: <a href="http://www.legacyhealth.org/body.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&amp;id=13&amp;registration=true&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=36955">Car seat safety checks and recycling</a> from 10am to 2pm at Legacy Meridian Park.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you Legacy!!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Being that it&#39;s 9/11 and also my youngest daughter&#39;s first day in kindergarten, I&#39;m feeling a bit verklempt. So I&#39;ll be brief today so that I don&#39;t go all maudlin on you and burst into tears. Life is good, right? Transitions are important. </p><p>So that is why I&#39;ve chosen the important topic of melons for today&#39;s post. Yes, melons. In some ways, it is good that I&#39;m an inexperienced gardener. I <a href="../../../../2008/08/tips-on-drying/">saved seeds last year</a> from some of the tastiest produce we ate. I talked with other local gardeners about growing melons. And they all told me not to bother. The summer here is <em>usually</em> not long enough or hot enough to grow melons. Do you think I listened? Ha! I did not. On the watermelon front, things aren&#39;t looking so good:</p><p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a5647751970b-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> </p><p>The watering can is tiny, making the watermelon about the size of a Roma tomato.</p><p>But check out this nice set of melons! If my baby girl (uh, I mean, big 5 year old kindergarten girl) wasn&#39;t at school right now I&#39;d make her hoist these two beauties up to her flat-as-a-board chest and model. But alas, not today. These babies might even make Dolly Parton feel small! </p><p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a56477f1970b-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> So here&#39;s the deal. I think this melon is called Orange Dream and it&#39;s somewhere between a cantaloupe and a honeydew. I have no idea what a ripe one is supposed to look like. Do I thump it? Do I sniff it? Should I take them bowling? Anyone, anyone? Advice most appreciated.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Portland, it&#39;s time to face the music: a life without Plastics Round-ups. When the economy tanked it&#0160;did some serious damage to&#0160;the recycled plastics industry; there just hasn&#39;t been as big a demand for the product. The company that took all of that plastic from the Round-ups has had to retool its business and can no longer take such a massive quantity or variety&#0160;of plastic. So, it&#39;s time for us (and everyone!) to take action and work on reducing the amount of plastic in our lives -- particularly plastics that can&#39;t be recycled.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been stockpiling crinkly plastic bags (in hopes that the Round-ups would return), like the kind that tortilla chips, some pastas&#0160;and Bob&#39;s Red Mill pancake mix comes in. These types of bags&#0160;cannot be recycled anywhere in the Portland area (and probably not in most other cities either). They are landfill-bound. This absolutely kills me, because manufacturing plastic is such an energy-intensive, high-emission process, and now I&#39;m just throwing it all away. So here is the perfect incentive to start making better choices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a5614364970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a> </p>
<p><em>(Bob, I love you, but this cannot go on.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s one idea:</strong> Buy pasta in cardboard boxes or in the bulk bins. I know my co-op primarily sells packaged pasta in those crinkly plastic bags, so I&#39;m going to ask them if there are any alternatives. (Sometimes businesses and manufacturers just need to hear from customers to make these little changes.)</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s another: </strong>I&#39;m pretty sure that Bob&#39;s pancake mix is also available in bulk bins at many grocery stores. But here&#39;s a radical thought: what about making your own pancake mix? This&#0160;idea never occurred to me until I discovered the excellent <a href="http://www.foodinjars.com/" target="_blank">Food in Jars</a> blog and Marisa&#39;s tasty-sounding <a href="http://www.foodinjars.com/2009/06/02/homemade-pancake-mix/" target="_blank">pancake mix recipe</a>. I also found <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Homemade-Pancake-Mix/Detail.aspx" target="_blank">another mix recipe on Allrecipes.com</a> that contains more basic ingredients. It would take five minutes to make these mixes. Store them in a sealed&#0160;container&#0160;and create a little label listing the&#0160;amounts of the wet ingredients.&#0160;Easy peasy!</p>
<p>Bang!&#0160;I just&#0160;eliminated two crinkly bags.&#0160;I will not be making my own tortilla chips (that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother level of crazy), but we seem to be consuming less of those anyway.</p>
<p>We stopped buying cold cereal&#0160;a few&#0160;months ago, so those liners aren&#39;t an issue for us. But what about you? Those liners are not recyclable. Can you reduce the amount of cereal you are eating? <a href="../../../../2008/09/whats-for-break/">Can you eat something else</a>&#0160;on occasion, like toast or eggs or muffins for breakfast?</p>
<p>What about those silver-colored crinkly goldfish/bunny-cracker bags? Not recyclable. Can you stove-top some popcorn to have on hand for salty snacks? <a href="../../../../2009/08/toasted-pumpkin-seeds-and-thoughts-on-the-mediterranean-diet/">Make toasted pumpkin seeds</a> or <a href="../../../../2008/08/healthy-snack-r/">soy nuts</a>?</p>
<p>I know it&#39;s hard to change food habits, particularly when it comes to kids. And you don&#39;t need to make allofthesechangesatonce. Nor do you need to completely stop buying bunny crackers cold turkey. But pick one piece of plastic that is headed for the landfill and try to figure out how to eliminate it from your life. Make it a habit and then move on to the next piece.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s brainstorm. What other types of plastic containers or packaging materials would you like to reduce? Do you have any success stories to share? (And darn it, I am going to make yogurt!!! Really!)</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a5b46090970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> This picture represents my sad, sad face. Note the mean-looking slanted eyebrows! The straight-line of the lips that&#39;s even worse than a frown! And no, I&#39;m not frowning because there&#39;s a bee on my nose. I&#39;m not frowning because of the very disappointing <a href="../../../../2009/09/no-more-sigg-bottles-for-this-family/">revelation of BPA liners in Sigg water bottles</a>, or <a href="../../../../2009/08/enviromom-supports-seattle-green-bag-campaign-approve-refendum-1/">Seattle&#39;s voting down of the disposable bag tax</a> or even finding out about how most of those <a href="../../../../2009/09/plastic-in-exfoliating-scrubs-grrr-what-will-they-foist-on-us-next/">mass marketed exfoliating scrubs have plastic beads</a> doing the scrubbing work! No, I&#39;m frowning because my lips are chapped. I hate that. To add insult to injury, it seems to be taking forever for my lips to heal. What&#39;s the deal? Probably just another value-add of getting older?? Wah. Boo-hoo. </p><p>I&#39;ve always been a bit of a lip balm addict, and when I realized several years ago how drying products that contained petroleum products were, I switched to more natural brands. You&#39;ll never find me without some Burts Bees or Kiss My Face balms nearby. But when your lips hurt, the minty tingle of Burts Bees is pretty much akin to CIA-inspired torture. At the recommendation of a natural foods store, my husband first tried Dr. Hauschka lip balm when he was going through a painful, chapped lip phase of his own. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just marketing, because that stuff really does seem to heal your mouth! Although it does take a while and that lip balm is pretty spendy -- about $15 for .14 ounces. This time, I don&#39;t know what gives. It&#39;s taking waaaaaay too long. </p><p>Obsessing over my chapped lips is one of the reasons I was so horrified to read about the plastics in exfoliating scrubs. I decided to exfoliate my chapped lips and it turned out that the scrub I&#39;d been using did have the dreaded polyethylene in it! I&#39;m torn on exfoliating chapped lips anyway. Honestly, which hurts more? The chapped lips or the exfoliation of chapped lips. It like the chicken and the egg thing. </p><p>In any case, I&#39;m pretty sure I first chapped my lips in August. I can pinpoint it to a day in a friend&#39;s pool when I probably got a bit too much sun on my face and didn&#39;t have my lip balm handy enough. Although, I was heroically supervising three semi-swim competent kids in a pool by myself, so putting their needs above mine was probably the best course. </p><p>How do you treat chapped lips? How much time should I give it before I request a lip-ectomy from my doctor? Any oils, unguents or lip balm products that you swear by? Help me. I want to smile again.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../../2009/09/returning-sigg-bottles-to-reusable-bags-and-rei-plus-patagonia-news/">Returning Sigg bottles to Reusable Bags and REI; plus Patagonia news</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Good news if you purchased your old Sigg bottles with the BPA liner from <a href="http://www.reusablebags.com/" target="_blank">Reusable Bags</a>: they will take them back for store credit, which could be used on a stainless bottle. Reusable Bags is the largest retailer of Sigg bottles so I&#39;m guessing this affects many of you. I purchased two of our bottles from them, so in response to my query I received this (paraphrased) email:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p><strong>We are also accepting SIGG bottles with the old liner in exchange for store credit for those who wish to try a different brand. </strong>Please send your bottles to:<br/><br/>ReusableBags.com <br/>c/o Customer Service<br/>116 W. Illinois St <br/>Suite 6E <br/>Chicago, Illinois 60654 <br/><br/>Please include your full name and your order number(s) if you still have them. When we receive your bottles we will contact you with your store credit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with your name, I&#39;d also include all of your contact info. For more questions, contact them at service [at] reusablebags [dot] com.</p>
<p>As we&#0160;mentioned last week, if you just want to swap your old Sigg for one with the new liner, <a href="http://mysigg.com/bulletin/exchange_program.html" target="_blank">visit&#0160;the Sigg&#0160;Web site for instructions and to download a mailing label</a>. Note that this offer expires October 31.</p>
<p>I took one of our bottles back to <a href="http://www.rei.com/" target="_blank">REI</a>&#0160;over the weekend, without a receipt. Since we are REI members, they had a record of the purchase so I exchanged it for a Kleen Kanteen with no hassle. If you purchased one there but aren&#39;t a member and don&#39;t have a receipt, they will not accept it.</p>
<p>Sigg is experiencing more PR woes: <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/" target="_blank">Patagonia</a> has severed its ties with the company according to a press release we received. The two companies were involved in co-marketing and co-branding efforts. I found this quote extremely disturbing:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>“We did our homework on the topic of BPA, going all the way back to 2005 when this subject first emerged in discussions in scientific journals” Rick Ridgeway, Patagonia’s VP of environmental initiatives states. “We even arranged for one of the leading scientists on BPA research to come to our company to educate us on the issue.&#0160; Once we concluded there was basis for concern, we immediately pulled all drinking bottles that contained BPA from our shelves and then&#0160; searched for a BPA-free bottle.&#0160; We very clearly asked SIGG if there was BPA in their bottles and their liners, and they clearly said there was not.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">While I&#39;m super disappointed in Sigg, I sure hope this serves as a warning to other companies that greenwashing will ultimately come back and bite you in the ass -- or possibly bite it off entirely.</p>

Using what science can tell us, it imagines what would happen to our world if humans ceased to exist. It also talks about what the world was like before humans existed, and also examines life with humans, and some of the poor choices we make with large scale consequences. If it sounds kind of gloom and doom, it&#39;s not. It&#39;d oddly hopeful. I&#39;ll probably write more about it once I&#39;ve finished it. At this point, I&#39;d highly recommend it. </p><p>It&#39;s the kind of book that has interesting lessons at every turn of the page. And some shockers. Here&#39;s one...&#0160; Those exfoliating body and facial scrub products that make our skin feel so soft and clean? The majority of the mass produced exfoliating products are not using natural things like ground up pumice stone, apricot pits or loofah bits. Nope. They are using plastic. Can you believe that?! Frankly, I didn&#39;t want to believe it. So I went to the store today, and I looked at ten exfoliating scrub products, and yes-sir-ee-bob. They contain plastic. Read the product labels and you will likely find the following ingredients: micro-fine polyethylene granules, polyethylene spheres or beads, or plain old polyethylene. The only ones I found that didn&#39;t have plastic were from the St. Ives brand, which did have walnut shells or apricot pits, and several that listed all natural ingredients.</p><p>In the chapter titled &#39;Polymers Are Forever,&#39; scientists who study what washes up on seashores and goes into the gullets of sea creatures are discovering increasing amounts of microscopic bits of plastic from exfoliating products:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&#39;They&#39;re selling plastic meant to go right down the drain, into the sewers, into the rivers, right into the ocean. Bite-size pieces of plastic to be swallowed by little sea creatures.&#39; </p><p>Why should we care? Lots of reasons, including that the tiniest sea creatures who eat the plastic are eaten by bigger creatures all the way up the food chain. You are probably aware that <a href="../../../../2009/03/environmental-considerations-of-human-waste-good-read-really/">water treatment plants aren&#39;t designed to filter out tiny things like microscopic plastic beads and medicines</a>. I don&#39;t know about you. I am not a plastics abolitionist yet. But I&#39;m considering it. Do you think it&#39;s possible to live life without plastics?</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../../2009/09/making-granola-in-the-crockpot-and-oven/">Making granola in the crockpot and oven</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a544b966970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a></p>
<p>Seriously? Crockpot granola? Yes.</p>
<p>First off, prior to this I&#39;ve never made granola. I&#39;ve consumed mass quantities of bulk bin&#0160;Golden Temple Super Nutty granola, AKA the best damn granola ever, but never tried to concoct my own. Why mess with perfection? Well, as I learned with <a href="../../../../2009/08/updates-pizzicato-gardening-and-salsamaking/">salsa</a>,&#0160;oftentimes homemade can be just as good (or better). Recently while browsing around the Interwebs I stumbled onto a <a href="http://www.crockpot365.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">site devoted to crockpot cooking</a>. And yes, she had <a href="http://crockpot365.blogspot.com/2008/11/crockpot-granola-recipe.html" target="_blank">made granola</a>, which just sounded so intriguing and do-able. I&#39;ve also been trying to vary my children&#39;s breakfast routine away from the standard whole wheat toast with P.B. and honey. They&#39;re a little bored with it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a544ba07970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Homemadegranola002" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a544ba07970b image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a544ba07970b-800wi.jpg" title="Homemadegranola002"/></a> </p>
<p>Solution? Let finicky son make the granola and maybe he&#39;ll want to eat it! So into the crockpot he measured:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>5 cups of old-fashioned rolled oats</p>
<p>1/2 cup of honey</p>
<p>1/4 cup of canola oil</p>
<p>1 tsp cinnamon</p>
<p>(I would have preferred lots and lots of other nuts, seeds and fruits, but he objected.)</p></blockquote>
<p>We set the crockpot on low, vented the lid with a wooden spoon and let it cook for three hours, stirring it about every 30 minutes. Et voila, crunchy, lightly sweet granola! The verdict? Two small thumbs up.</p>
<p>But...for me, the joy of a crockpot comes from being able to leave your food cooking for hours while you&#39;re off doing other things. Not thinking about it until you walk through the door and are greeted with the smell of dinner. You can&#39;t do that with crockpot granola or it will burn. It seems like the complaint I&#39;ve heard most about oven-baked granola is that it can burn really easily and that it&#39;s hard to stir it up on a baking sheet. So I decided to try it in order to compare the experience with the crockpot.</p>
<p>Working <em>very loosely</em> from an <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/foodday/index.ssf/2008/06/recipe_detail.html?id=6645" target="_blank">Elephants Delicatessen recipe</a> (the entirety of which sounds delicious),&#0160;I mixed together:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>4 cups of old-fashioned oats</p>
<p>1/2 cup of real maple syrup</p>
<p>1/2 cup of canola oil</p>
<p>1 tsp cinnamon</p>
<p>1/2 tsp nutmeg</p></blockquote>
<p>I used a baking&#0160;pan that has really high sides, like 2 inches high (makes it easier to stir) and spread&#0160;the mixture&#0160;evenly. The entire mass was about 1/2 inch deep. Stuck it into a pre-heated 300 degree oven and stirred it every 10 minutes (I set the timer as a reminder). In 30 minutes it was done (and smelling like Thanksgiving, just heavenly). As it cools, the granola gets crisp. And dang this is good granola, and so much faster. Hmm. (I actually like it better than the crockpot recipe, but that&#39;s probably due to the maple syrup and nutmeg. I&#39;m sure it would taste the same in the crockpot.) And this is not clumping granola -- I think you have to add a whole lot more sweetener for that, and I&#39;m trying to keep it low sugar. It&#39;s plenty sweet as is.</p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a544ba75970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a59ba491970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a></p>
<p>The crockpot method worked well for me because I was slow-roasting a slab o&#39; pig that day, so the oven was in use and I was around all afternoon. I also understand that crockpots use less energy (after all, you&#39;re only heating exactly what you&#39;re cooking, whereas an oven heats the entire box when you&#39;re only using a small portion of that box). If you are in baking mode and whipping up a batch of muffins or bread, then it absolutely makes sense to have some granola cooking in the crockpot at the same time. Or if you&#39;re just puttering around the house. Either way, it&#39;s really tasty and there are a million recipes out there. Mine are obviously super bare-bones, trying to please a delicate palate. Mostly it just feels really good to be able to make something yummy and healthy for&#0160;my family.</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to hear other granola tales and combos. Share &#39;em if you got&#0160;&#39;em!</p>

And they are just laying around, all over my backyard! I wouldn&#39;t have realized these were diamonds, had it not been for the imaginative six kids who participated in our &#39;home camp&#39; experiment this summer. </p><p>Simple idea: Six kids. Four hours. One mom. Scheduled three times over a week, once at each family&#39;s house. We held &#39;home camp&#39; during two far apart weeks this summer. It gave the kids lots of time to play inside and out. And the moms a little bit of free time, after hosting one of the playdates. </p><p>I did my last &#39;home camp&#39; hosting event today, and except for one wipe-out while playing hide-n-go-seek, it went fairly well. The first week we hosted it, I ended up doing some really fast talking when the veracity of the tooth fairy&#39;s existence was questioned by one of the 7-year-olds. But all in all, it was a pretty successful experiment. A great way to provide a little bit of structure, something akin to day camp, but with no associated cost. </p><p>The few other camps we paid to attend this summer were mostly top-notch, and the money saved during our &#39;home camp&#39; weeks helped justify the price of the best (and most expensive) camp we did. I wrote about what we fondly call &#39;<a href="../../../../2008/08/outdoor-kids-di/">hippie farm camp</a>&#39; last year, and this year&#39;s experience lived up to our high expectations. </p><p>While I realize many of you have probably started back to school and may be in that frenzied attempt to regain a routine, what were your best outdoor moments this summer? </p>
