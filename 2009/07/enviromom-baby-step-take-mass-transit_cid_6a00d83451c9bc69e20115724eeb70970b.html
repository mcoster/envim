Why? Because that&#39;s the way our student would get around during her 3-week stay. I liked that I wouldn&#39;t be expected to be her personal chauffeur (crikey -- I do that enough with my own kids!). But bus schedules? Um well. Hmmm. Let me get back to you on that. Oh sure, I&#39;ve heard about Trimet. Apparently, it&#39;s a wonderful mass transit system that cities all over the world admire and study. Which is all fine and good. But what I needed to know is how to get from point A to point B, and all the FAQs the exchange student might ask me. Because surely she would, wouldn&#39;t she: &#39;What&#39;s the fare? How will I know when to get off? Where do I buy a bus pass?&#39; Factor in that she&#39;d be fresh off the airplane, jet-legged, applying classroom English language skills to the real world, and using this funny green money we have. We really should have a category called &#39;Pathetic&#39; because this post would fit perfectly. I don&#39;t know any of these mass transit things, because I&#39;ve never taken the bus myself. I know, I know! I&#39;m beyond lame. </p><p>So picture it. The first morning after this lovely 17-year old South Korean student comes into our lives, we walk her down to the bus stop nearest our house and I&#39;m trying to convince her that she can do this: &#39;You&#39;ll be fine! Really. Take this dollar bill and two shiny quarters and give it to the bus driver and sit up front and ask the driver to tell you to get off at Pioneer Square. REALLY! IT&#39;S EASY! YOU CAN DO IT! YES YOU CAN!!&#39; All the while, I&#39;m shaking in my boots, worrying: &#39;Can she do this? Holy crap! What if she misses the stop? What if some weirdo gives her a hard time?&#39; I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m such a freakish worrier. Long story short? She took the bus. She got a bus pass. She had one weird lady grab her arm once. She took it all in stride. Sheesh! I AM PATHETIC!</p><p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20115724e9191970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Waiting-bus" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20115724e9191970b image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20115724e9191970b-800wi.jpg" title="Waiting-bus"/></a> Now this next part might shock you. Yesterday, I got on a bus <strong>by myself</strong>. I took it downtown. I took a picture of my feet waiting at the bus stop!! I truly am a freak! I&#39;m the weirdo! Taking pictures of myself -- a 42 year old mom who speaks English, knows the currency, and who has traveled around the world to boot -- but kind of stressed out about taking a city bus for the first time. Would I be late? Would I miss the bus? Would I look like the weirdo freak that I felt like? I won&#39;t answer that. But the bus came right on time. The bus driver was exceptionally nice to me when I did not know where to put my bus ticket. I managed to panic a little and get off a few stops early, but it all worked out and I just walked a few extra blocks. You know what? Wait for it... I&#39;d do it again. Next time I&#39;ll take my kids. Or bring my iPod so I look like a professional bus rider. Yep. There was beauty in not getting lost driving my car as I invariably do downtown, or forgetting which floor of the parking garage I was on. </p><p>Here&#39;s the kicker. I went to a meeting at City Hall. Much more about that later, but be warned that it&#39;s really good stuff. One of the attendees was from the <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/TRANSPORTATION/index.cfm?c=43801">Portland SmartTrips program</a>, from which I&#39;ve benefited. And she talked about the goal of their program: getting people to engage in a dialog about driving less (single occupancy vehicles). And the hope that the dialog gives options, opens minds, guilts you into walking, biking, carpooling or taking mass transit -- whatever it takes to break the single-occupancy car vice grip that&#39;s squeezing far too many of us. So I sat there smiling to myself. It worked. It took time. But I am changing my behavior. Next time -- when it&#39;s below 100 degrees, I&#39;ll ride my bike. </p><p>One last thing. I know I am middle class. I know there are tons of great people who&#39;ve already figured this out in a far less pathetic way than me. That there are people who take mass transit out of necessity and wish they had cars. Regardless, I&#39;ve chosen to post about this because there are probably a lot of you out there -- who are in the middle like me -- and may just need that little extra nudge to try mass transit. And not be so pathetic, like me. We can do this! Yes we can! </p>
