				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20115711d91ed970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> Typically we don&#39;t drive our family&#39;s one car very much, and fill the gas tank only once a month. The rest of the time we take the school bus, walk or bike. We carpool frequently when we do drive. I love not being &#39;behind the wheel&#39; all the time.</p><p>What with our &#39;driving&#39; vacation to Seattle, being my dad&#39;s Florence Nightingale for his recent surgery and recovery (it was fairly routine, and he&#39;s doing well, thank you), and now this weekend&#39;s camping trip, I feel like I live in my freaking car. I&#39;ve gone through two months&#39; worth of gas in 3 weeks&#39; time. Me and my car are connected at the hip. And I&#39;m tired of it. After camping, we may have to file for legal separation. And my husband will have to do all the driving this weekend while I look at nature from the passenger seat, providing exceptional map and navigational support. Ah, yes. Things are sounding better already.</p><p>So as enviro and alt-commute friendly as we try to be, don&#39;t you think life would be easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy as far as getting the kids to walk???? Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!! Oooooh, boy. That&#39;s a good one. More like: &quot;Mom. Do we HAVE to walk to the park?? Why can&#39;t we DRIVE? It&#39;s tooooooo hot today.&quot; Excuse me while I count to ten. </p><p>In hope of support for my &#39;let&#39;s not drive&#39; campaign, I <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/enviromom-20/detail/0374320004">picked up the children&#39;s book Tin Lizzie by Allan Drummond</a>, recently recommended by EnviroMom reader RoseG. I have to say, I really like this book. From the invention of Ford&#39;s first car for the masses, to today, the book talks to kids about the problems of too many cars. But unlike other kid books that simplify the answers and conclude with happy little rhyming couplets about how Doug the Slug and Kerm the Worm ate all the yucky food waste in the compost pile and then global warming was fixed and we all lived happily ever after (has anyone else read books like this?), this book ends with questions for kids to think about. Previewing it made me wonder if my kids will really groove on it and form their own little book club. Or if they&#39;ll get all &quot;Well, what&#39;s the answer? Why didn&#39;t this author write the end!&quot; </p><p>What do you think? Will the kids of the EnviroMoms like it? How about the kids of the fantastic families we are going to camp with this weekend? Ha, ha, ha! It&#39;s going to be a cliff-hanger today. I&#39;m taking the book camping with us and plan to spring it on all the kids. So we will see.... </p><p>Have a great weekend everyone!</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../../2009/07/what-to-do-with-old-mini-blinds/">What to do with old mini blinds?</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201157117212d970c-pi" style="FLOAT: right"></a> I will never, ever, ever again purchase mini blinds. Ever. Perhaps because I&#39;ve always gone with cheap-o aluminum, cut &#39;em while you wait blinds, I&#39;ve always ended up hating them after awhile. A couple of years ago I took down some metal blinds in our son&#39;s room, and they&#39;ve been sitting in our laundry room (aka the room where unused&#0160;household items&#0160;go to die) ever since. They must go! But where?</p>
<p>Most Goodwill-type places won&#39;t accept them. In fact, I don&#39;t know of any organization that will. I have, however, come up with&#0160;four tantalizing options:</p>
<p>1) List them for free on Craigslist or Freecycle. Someone, <em>someone</em> is certainly looking for blinds of this exact proportion. Certainly!</p>
<p>2) Dismantle them and put the metal parts in the curbside recycling bin. You can do this in Portland -- I checked with Metro. But <em>any</em> curbside program that accepts scrap metal should accept them. You just need to make sure you&#39;re only putting in metal pieces -- that there isn&#39;t any plastic attached or embedded somewhere -- and that you cut it down to size if needed. In Portland, scrap metal must be no larger than 30 inches in any direction.</p>
<p>3) Take them to the <a href="http://blindrecycler.com/Home_Page.html" target="_blank">Blind Recycler</a>. Yes, Portland&#0160;metro&#0160;peeps, we have a blind recycler up in Vancouver! (Sorry everyone else.) They will accept any kind of window covering except draperies for recycling. For FREE. So even vinyl mini blinds, or the miserable, broken&#0160;roller shade from IKEA that I bought to replace the miserable metal mini blinds. If you really want to be an enviro-star, ask your friends if they have any window coverings to recycle, collect&#0160;them all&#0160;and make one trip.</p>
<p>4) Keep them and get crafty! I found some interesting reuse ideas for mini blinds. You could <a href="http://littlegreennotebook.blogspot.com/2009/02/make-shades-out-of-mini-blinds.html" target="_blank">take your old mini blinds and turn them into shades</a>, which is pretty impressive. Or you could <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1666776/how_to_make_free_plant_labels_from.html?cat=24" target="_blank">turn your vinyl mini blinds into plant labels</a>. Finally, you might enjoy cutting <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hg/index.ssf/2008/12/maxing_the_minis_new_ideas_for.html" target="_blank">up your vinyl blinds into gift tags and ribbons, or weaving them into coasters</a>! Or not.</p>
<p>The thing with vinyl mini blinds -- you have to be careful about lead. Back in 1996 the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML96/96150.html" target="_blank">CPSC discovered lead in&#0160;vinyl blinds imported from Mexico and Asia</a>. The plastic would break down, causing lead dust to form making it a serious health hazard for tots. If you think your blinds qualify,&#0160;throw them out.</p>
<p>Any other recycling or reuse ideas for mini blinds to share?</p>

				<p>We&#39;re going camping this weekend with a great group of friends and surprisingly, I&#39;m not in a tizzy getting ready. I think it&#39;s thanks to the collective wisdom of the bunch, and that there will be a pack of kids who all know and like one another and <em>should</em> play nicely together, and the fact that we&#39;ll be bringing lots of beer on ice. We &#39;car camp&#39; about once per summer. Although last summer we flaked out at the last minute because it was the end of August, and by then we moms decided it was time for summer to be OVER and the work of planning and packing all the necessary gear sounded far too exhausting. I&#39;m making it sound like we don&#39;t like camping, when that&#39;s not the case at all. We love camping for it&#39;s way of <a href="../../../../2007/08/outdoor-kids-i-/">releasing the outdoor kid in all of us</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201157209cadf970b-pi" style="float: right;"></a> This particular trip has been in the works for a few months. Trying to get five or more families to commit to the same weekend during summer turned out to be next to impossible. Although we did have five registered at one point, one recently had to bow out. THEN it was discovered that the camp site we picked was horribly infested with recently hatched <strong>ravenous</strong> mosquitoes. Like an x-file (remember that show?)! The moms scrambled. We swapped sites in the hopes we will have fewer encounters with blood sucking insects. Regardless, we plan to come well armed: lotions, potions, sprays, wrist bands, vitamin supplements, high-pitched buzzing devices, citronella candles, camp-fire, thick clothing layers, you name it! Anything to keep the dreaded itchy-scratchy at bay. One of our moms offered to bring a bunch of the more natural, less toxic potions for all of us to sample. Please imagine me looking around, lowering my voice and making sure no one is hearing an EnviroMom say this next part: <em>And some DEET-based option to use as a last resort</em>. We are locked and loaded. </p><p>How do you keep the skeeters at bay as non-toxically as possible? Any products you love or hate? Please share!</p><p>(photo by phillyburbs.com/courier times)</p>

				<p>It&#39;s done! Woo hoo! I&#39;ve spent years dreaming of what our kitchen could be one day. All of those HGTV redesign shows and home decor magazines fueled a serious case of kitchen envy that had me sketching and measuring and wondering if we&#39;d ever be able to afford our dream kitchen makeover. And then the dream shifted (along with the economy). It became less about the sleek cabinets and the hi-tech appliances and the giant island/gathering place and the maybe-we-can-bump-out-a-wall scenarios and more about how to get the biggest bang for our dwindling bucks while keeping it eco-friendly. It was about appreciating what we had and figuring out what would really make us happy. Big impact with little planetary and bank account impact. We called it the Recession Remodel.</p>
<p>Our kitchen started out like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201157203a83d970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a> </p>
<p>Dark and cramped, with a horrible vinyl floor that never seemed to look clean after a washing.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20115710a43be970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> I&#39;ve been running around like the proverbial chicken with its head cut off since we got home from our vacation the weekend before last. And I was in a similar mode in the early days of summer running up to our vacation. How did I manage to over-schedule our summer so quickly and efficiently? Isn&#39;t summer is supposed to be lazy and fun? I counted on one hand how many relaxing summer days there has been so far: two. With today being the second one. </p><p>After picking 25 pounds of raspberries and some early blues over the weekend, today&#39;s goal was simple. Can raspberry jam before the remaining fresh fruit in the fridge goes funk (the bulk of the berries were frozen over the weekend). With nothing on the schedule, we eased into our day, staying in jammies until it was time to put on our aprons and make the jam. </p><p>To be honest, I&#39;m not particularly skilled in the kitchen and even less so when it involves highly distracted cooking with my kids. I often fall into that trap of doing for my kids because I know things will go faster and smoother, yet ideally, I want the kids to learn how to take care of themselves, to make their own good, fresh food, line dry their own laundry, etc. One might think with a blog about &#39;raising green kids&#39; that mine would be ready to go all &#39;Little House on the Prairie&#39; on their own by now. Ha! But no time better than the present to green these little city urchins, no? </p><p>So I read the directions for making raspberry jam. Then I reread. And reread. Then I got ready: sterilized jars/lids/rims, boiling water canner, tongs and wide-mouthed funnel, mixing bowl, big stainless steel pot, measuring devices, towels -- really, just about everything but the darned kitchen sink! I had to talk myself down off the ledge a few times: YES, you can do this! REALLY, they&#39;re going to take direction well!! There will be no THIRD DEGREE BURNS requiring emergency medical care!!</p>

<p>Pardon me while I jot down a little to-do list. </p>
<p>1) Work with neighbors to start a collective, like the <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1216/is_6_222/ai_n31976621/" target="_blank">Ainsworth Street Collective</a> featured last month in <a href="http://www.sunset.com/" target="_blank">Sunset Magazine</a>.&#0160;Email the woman you met yesterday who&#39;s part of it. Investigate <a href="http://brightneighbor.com/" target="_blank">Bright Neighbor</a>, a Web site designed to help Portland neighborhoods set up sharing programs.</p>
<p>2)&#0160;Start saving for a&#0160;<a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/07/oregon_opens_the_tap_wider_for.html" target="_blank">gray water&#0160;system as discussed in today&#39;s Oregonian article</a>. Bathroom reno in 1-2 years...hopefully by then gray water systems will be legal in Oregon!</p>
<p>3) Test CFL bulbs in kitchen recessed light fixtures for best light quality. Keep hoping that LED technology will improve so the lights&#0160;aren&#39;t so cold and blue!</p>
<p>4) Sew bulk food bags using monster pile of fabric in laundry room. It can&#39;t be that hard.</p>
<p>5) Fight the plastics industry -- and <a href="http://adage.com/video/article?article_id=137753" target="_blank">their stupid campaign</a>&#0160;to get millenials to think plastic is really cool --&#0160;by buying less plastic. Seriously: make the yogurt and the <a href="../../../../2009/01/but-i-dont-want-to-make-my-own-salsa/">salsa</a> already, and take a bread-baking class if you have to. It&#39;s time.</p>
<p>6) Despite your recent&#0160;good hair days, rethink the Pantene Pro-V shampoo. You may look good on the surface, but what is the guilt doing to your inner child? Not to mention the sodium lauryl sulfate? Try the no-poo for a month? Will it make my straight, fine hair limp and greasy? There&#39;s only one way to find out.</p>
<p>7) Sweat more: on the bike, on a hike, at the community center gym, playing kickball at the park. Be a better active role model for your children.</p>
<p>There! Why am I still sitting here?</p>
<p>Feel free to add your to-dos in the comments.&#0160;(It&#0160;will feel good to get them out of your head.)&#0160;And have a glorious weekend!</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2011570f1b528970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Bdaycard" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e2011570f1b528970c image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2011570f1b528970c-800wi.jpg" title="Bdaycard"/></a></p>
<p>Despite our virtual connectedness and the popularity of e-cards and e-vites, the greeting card industry still seems pretty healthy. But even if you choose recycled-content cards with soy-based ink, there&#39;s still a heavy environmental toll during the paper milling, printing&#0160;and transportation process.&#0160;All of that for&#0160;what is generally a 15-second experience of reading and setting aside,&#0160;and ultimately&#0160;<em>dis</em>carding&#0160;that card. Kate emailed us about this dilemma:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>Hi EnviroMoms,<br/>&#0160;<br/>I love your blog, and thanks for all of the great tips. I am relatively new to being green, and at first was totally overwhelmed by all of the possibilities. But I identify with your approach of taking things one step at a time.<br/>&#0160;<br/>Lately I have been absolutely floored by the cost and wastefulness of greeting cards. I recently spent more than $10 on two birthday cards, which likely ended up in the garbage (or hopefully a recycling bin!!) within days. My family of seven buys and exchanges goodness knows how many cards for goodness knows how many occasions.<br/>&#0160;<br/>Have you ever heard any innovative ideas for replacing greeting cards? How do you buck the trend and not insult the person whose birthday, anniversary, etc. you are celebrating?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not a fan of greeting cards and haven&#39;t sent a Christmas card in years. Pretty much the only cards that come from my family are the ones my kids make. Relatives&#39; birthdays are usually acknowledged with a homemade card, an email or phone call, and&#0160;mostly I avoid that greeting card aisle in the grocery store. Cards that we receive go into the recycling bin or&#0160;a reuse basket for future repurposing and occasionally get saved for the kids&#39; memento boxes. Sometimes I do receive a card that touches me or makes me laugh, and I do love a funny card. </p>
<p>However, if your extended family has a history of frequently exchanging cards, like Kate&#39;s family, how do you make changes? Do you have the conversation&#0160;that greeting cards aren&#39;t doing the planet any favors? Or do you just start sending alternative greeting cards -- e-cards, <a href="../../../../2008/12/youtube-holiday-greeting-card-2008/">video cards</a>, homemade -- and hope the family doesn&#39;t disown you and might possibly get on board the eco-wagon?</p>
<p>Do you send greeting cards? What&#39;s your alternative?</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2011570e61559970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> This is the summer of preserving berries and other delicious summer fruits! Our chest freezer awaits. We nailed strawberry season. Picking three separate times, a variety of Hoods and Shuksans from a local u-pick, and the unnamed variety from our garden. We hulled, we froze, we packed! A good 60 pounds. A job well done.</p><p>Now we are locked and loaded to pick raspberries this weekend. We will hopefully even take <a href="../../../../2009/05/evolving-view-of-travel-hosting-an-exchange-student/">our exchange student (who arrives tomorrow)</a> on her first American cultural adventure: the u-pick farm! After raspberries, it&#39;ll be blueberries, and closing out our season -- peaches. </p><p>Yet, my kids just threw me a zinger. Suddenly they like cherries. Can&#39;t get enough of them. You&#39;ll have to excuse the raised middle finger of my 4-year-old in the above picture. I don&#39;t believe she has any hidden message in raising it at the cherry bowl. She does it on a regular basis, and I find it mildly amusing. So far.</p><p>But here&#39;s the conundrum. Is it practical to preserve cherries? I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever had cherry jelly or jam, cherry relish, cherry sauce or frozen cherries. Maybe some dried cherries. And cherry pie. Also, I did have some cherry wine once, but that is not worth trying to replicate (Tiggers don&#39;t like cherry wine -- eee-yuck!). As I&#39;ve written, we have a fruit jam-packed (pun intended) summer already planned. Do we try to add in cherries and preserve those too? Or is it more trouble than it&#39;s worth? So I&#39;m asking you, dear readers... Do you preserve cherries? Is it worth the effort to pit and prep and preserve? And if you do, how do you eat them later in the year?</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../../2009/07/turning-the-wasteful-ready-mop-into-a-reusable-cleaning-tool/">Turning the wasteful Ready Mop into a reusable cleaning tool</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2011570decac4970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a></p>
<p>We bought our first Clorox Ready Mop about 7-8 years ago, right when they first came out. I loved it for all the wrong reasons -- the disposable mop head (no messy sponge to rinse!), the built-in toxic cleaning fluid (no inconvenient bucket!), the trigger that sprayed the solution for me&#0160;(no bending!). Then it stopped working after 3-4 years and we threw away the old one and bought the next generation Ready Mop, which worked <em>even better</em>. Then I woke up and realized it was no longer compatible with my lifestyle and set it aside for three years&#0160;(and basically stopped washing the kitchen floor). Seriously. I knew at some point we&#39;d be ripping out that old vinyl, but had no idea it would take three years. Ew.</p>
<p>Now I have a new Marmoleum kitchen floor and I love it. I want to keep it clean all the time. The minute I spill something I&#39;m down with a sponge or towel, mopping it up. I&#39;m going to take good care of this floor because I want it to last. So it was time to revisit the old Ready Mop, which was gathering dust in the garage.&#0160;Luckily I hadn&#39;t tossed the empty cleaning solution bottle, so I filled it with 1/4 white vinegar and 3/4 water. For the mop head I used a washcloth. And guess what? It works perfectly, while still providing the convenience for which it was intended. Except now I toss the mop head into the laundry rather than the garbage. I think I was inspired to try this by a reader comment (wish I could find it) -- so thank you. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve been inspired by you all!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2011570decbb6970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> </p>
<p>I would not advise running out to buy a Ready Mop because it&#39;s still a cheap, plastic gadget. I have no faith that I&#39;ll be using it in another 3-4 years because, inevitably, it will break and be destined for the landfill. (I will one day replace it with something more durable.) But if you own one already or its Swiffer counterpart, you can resurrect it and use it&#0160;safely and waste-freely once more.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2011570d6e17b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> Home sweet home after our week&#39;s vacation in Seattle. One of the people we visited was my almost 91-year-old grandmother. Born in 1918, I often wonder what she thinks of the changes that have come about in her lifetime. Sliced bread and all sorts of modern convenience. Is it progress or not? In old pictures, I see her as a child wearing black leather lace-up boots and hand-embroidered dresses. Far contrast from the factory-produced jeans and shoes my kids wear. </p><p>The email we received from EnviroMom reader Maggie about &#39;generation green&#39; could not have been more timely:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">enviromoms - I make an effort to be green. &#0160;I learn more all
the time from your blog, the internet, books, friends... &#0160;Turns out, I
really didn&#39;t need to go all that far. &#0160;A recent visit to my
grandmothers&#39; retirement community is all it really takes to see it is
that it is only recently we have forgotten how to conserve. &#0160;She is 83.
&#0160;I spent only 5 hours with her today. &#0160;In that short time I witnessed
the following green habits (both hers and her friends):</div><ul>
<li>buy local produce</li>
<li>eat more produce than meat</li>
<li>buy food basics and actually COOK</li>
<li>keep furniture for more than 20 years</li>
<li>keep clothing for more than 4 years</li>
<li>use a handkerchief</li>
<li>carpool</li>
<li>do errands all at once</li>
<li>turn off lights when you leave the room</li>
<li>keep leftovers AND
 eat them</li>
<li>reuse bags</li>
<li>reuse paper napkins or use cloth</li>
<li>hair does not need to be washed every day</li>
<li>share magazines with friends</li>
<li>in place of TV, play bridge</li>
<li>bring a spoon (not plastic) from home to accompany your snack, it fits in a purse</li>
</ul>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">She
has been living her life this way for decades. &#0160;Maybe you have already
written about this generation or about how it is only recently that our
lives have changed to be so wasteful. &#0160;If not, consider a visit to a
retirement community. &#0160;It opened my eyes a great deal.<br/></div><p>Thank you Maggie for sharing your grandma&#39;s inspiring green ways. There&#39;s so much we can learn from our elders. I&#39;d guess all of us have wisdom gained from our own grandmas to share. However, I hope you&#39;ll excuse me now, as it&#39;s time for lunch, and I need to go slice some bread.</p><br/>
