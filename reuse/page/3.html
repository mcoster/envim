		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20134828cffba970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Foodstorage014" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20134828cffba970c image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20134828cffba970c-800wi.jpg" title="Foodstorage014"/></a> <br/></p>
<p>In this reusable shopping bag are five containers for the following: honey, maple syrup, olive oil, powdered dishwasher detergent and a general-use cleaning spray. I can buy all of these items in bulk at my grocery store -- something I only fully discovered a few weeks ago. I tend to be a very focused shopper -- I&#39;ve got my list and my staple foods&#0160;and the&#0160;sections that I always skip (crackers,&#0160;cereal)&#0160;and there is little deviation from the routine. But one day I mindfully wandered up and down the aisles and really paid attention. I noted that the store carried my Biokleen dishwasher detergent in bulk as well as their cleaning spray. Then I noticed -- for the very first time -- the amazing liquid bulk foods section: organic canola and olive oil, tamari sauce, maple syrup, two kinds of honey and a few other items. How could I have missed this before?</p>
<p>Getting into this habit isn&#39;t too hard, but like any baby step you just have to be ready and wanting to embrace it. I was ready. Here&#39;s how I established this new habit:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>1) I made a list of all the bulk liquid & cleaning products that I knew I&#39;d buy.</p>
<p>2) As we ran out of those items, I rinsed and set the empty containers on the counter as a reminder.</p>
<p>3) When I had a few set aside I brought them to the store and immediately went to a cashier to have them all weighed at once. They weigh the empty containers, called the &#39;tare weight&#39;, and then subtract that weight when you check out so that you aren&#39;t paying for the container weight. The cashier writes the tare weight on a sticker, which stays on the container.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t tell you how many times someone has seen me filling up my glass honey jar and remarked, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you could do that!&quot; I know! It&#39;s not a&#0160;huge money-saver for most things&#0160;-- I think I save about $1 on the honey and maple syrup each time. The biggest saver is the&#0160;cleaning spray, because I only need a couple of tablespoons of solution. The rest is water that I fill up at home --- I&#0160;love not paying for water! For the most part&#0160;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really enough overall&#0160;savings to&#0160;motivate the average consumer to go this route, but <em>dang</em> it feels really good doing it. Particularly when I refilled that spray bottle, knowing I wasn&#39;t bringing another plastic container into the house. That felt <em>great</em>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We first posted about our friend Christy K., a brilliant and lovely fellow <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler</a> co-hort of ours, when she envisioned putting together a <a href="../../../2008/02/birthday-party/">durable party kit for her son&#39;s birthday party</a>, then had to pretty much pull an all-nighter to finish sewing all the cloth napkins in time (which totally sounds like something I would do). </p><p>This is the first time I&#39;ve had an opportunity to actually see her party kit and rent it for a gathering of our own. Yes, if you&#39;ve been following along with my posts -- it is game time. My beautiful girl gets to <a href="../../../2010/04/celebrating-a-family-culture-of-reuserepair/">put on that white veil</a>, walk down the aisle and experience First Holy Communion this Sunday. We&#39;re having a little feast / gathering with the grand-parents and God-parents afterward. If you know anything about me, you know I wouldn&#39;t be caught dead buying paper plates, napkins and throwaway plastic utensils! Well, um, OK. That last party I just might have used paper plates made from recycled content. But that was several years ago, and I&#39;m much more evolved in my eco-freakness now. This time, there was NO WAY I could hold my head up high and serve people on paper plates, with paper napkins and plastic forks. Absolutely not. Plus there&#39;s no way I could accommodate that amount of trash given our commitment to <a href="../../../join-enviromoms-one-can-a/">putting out just one garbage can a month</a>. </p><p>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013480b91054970c-pi" style="float: right;"></a> But of course, here I have no excuses, because Christy has done all the work and put together not one, but TWO party kits that she rents to friends and neighbors for a nominal fee. It is just so beautifully and efficiently done that I had to post about it today! She&#39;s got a nice tub with lid to keep it all together. Each kit contains:</p><ul>
<li>30 small plates</li>
<li>30 small cups</li>
<li>30 forks</li>
<li>30 spoons</li>
<li>30 knives</li>
<li>30 cloth napkins</li>
</ul>
<p>Is that not a thing of beauty? She&#39;s included tips on the most efficient washing method (dishwasher), and spot treating the cloth napkins. There&#39;s a checklist so you can inventory after your fete, and return it all in ship-shape condition.&#0160;</p><p>I feel like I still have a mountain of prep to get ready for Sunday&#39;s party, but this aspect is taken care of in style. Durable party kits rock! Well done, Christy.</p>

My mother was adjusting my white tulle veil. Can you blame her? I&#39;m her only daughter. There&#39;s only one first communion, and not a whole lot of other opportunities in life to dress all in white with a veil! Lo and behold, her ring snagged on my veil while primping. Ripping a giant hole in the back. Somehow I remained unaware of this mini calamity or forgot (because, heck, I looked great from the front, and what else matters?). Years later, after spying the veil in a closet, I got it out to play dress-up. After my clandestine playing, I noticed the hole. And came to the immediate conclusion that I must have done it, and holy cow, was I ever going to be in BIG TROUBLE if my mom found out. It wasn&#39;t until my oldest daughter started preparing for her first communion that I learned the real story. Phew! One less thing to go to confession for. <br/><br/>My mom had bought a first communion dress at a rummage sale several years ago, and it has been waiting in the closet (pawed and drooled over for some time by my two girls). My oldest, bless her heart, asked if she could wear my old veil with the second-hand dress, after I mentioned I could probably fix it by replacing the tulle. It turned out to be a simple afternoon project. Nothing like <a href="../../../2010/04/replacing-a-jacket-zipper-have-i-lost-my-mind/">replacing a zipper</a>. <br/><br/>Now this coming May, my mom and I, along with the rest of our families will get to see our beautiful daughter walk down the aisle in the white veil I once wore. My mom and I promise to be cautious (and ring-free!) when primping. <br/><br/>I am like a broken record in our home when it comes to Reduce and Reuse. Sometimes I think my words falls on deaf ears. But when my daughter asked if she could wear my old veil, I knew the message had gotten through. It is a blessing to raise a child who doesn&#39;t look down on second-hand goods and values vintage over new. Holes and all.

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>One of our fave local non-profits, <a href="http://childrensbookbank.org/">The Children&#39;s Book Bank</a>, is hosting a book drive for the 40th anniversary of Earth Day! I&#39;ve posted about this great organization before when our <a href="../../../2009/04/reuse-spiffing-up-used-board-books-for-kids-in-need/">service club helped spiff up a big ol&#39; stack of books</a>, that in turn are donated to local kids who might otherwise have NO BOOKS AT ALL in their homes. The thought of which makes me want to weep. </p>
<p>What an easy way to both clear out some clutter while in &#39;spring cleaning&#39; mode and support a fantastic non-profit reuse organization on Earth Day. It&#39;s a win-win! Here&#39;s the scoop:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please bring new and gently-used children&#39;s books to your local New 
Seasons Market April 24th to help The Children&#39;s Book Bank reach their 
goal of gathering 30,000 community-donated books for Portland&#39;s 
children in need. Other locations include Whole Foods Bridgeport and 
Laurelhurst. For more information please visit 
<a href="http://www.childrensbookbank.org/" target="_blank">www.childrensbookbank.org</a>.</p></blockquote>

				On Sunday, EnviroMom very quietly celebrated it&#39;s third birthday. So today I&#39;ve got a few reuse &#39;idea gifts&#39; for you!<br/><br/><strong>Reuse Orphan Socks!</strong> When we switched from plastic to metal water bottles, there was nothing I didn&#39;t love about the metal. Well, except one thing. One very tiny small thing. That metal on metal clanging noise when I put my water bottle in my bike&#39;s water bottle cage. Every bump. Every pothole. Clang, clang, rattle, bing, bang. I felt like <a href="http://www.oliviathepiglet.com/">Olivia the Pig</a> when she makes a band. Not an end of the world kind of problem, mind you. Just an annoyance. Solved with an orphan sock. Most people have a few of those. I&#39;m pretty sure we have more orphans than pairs. Slip the water bottle into a sock sleeve, and the metal rattle noise is gone. You save a sock from the rag bag by turning it into a water bottle sleeve! My youngest has also been known to cut the toe end off an orphan sock and turn them into home-made leg or arm warmers. I&#39;m pretty sure all the cool kids will soon be doing this too. <br/><br/><strong><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a916033e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="DSCN4006" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a916033e970b image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a916033e970b-800wi.jpg" title="DSCN4006"/></a> <br/> Reuse Old Tennis Balls!</strong> Here&#39;s another reuse trick that turns a practically useless thing useful again. Got any old tennis balls? We&#39;ve got a few. Why? I don&#39;t know (I guess I can&#39;t allow myself to throw them away). Last year, one got employed in a <a href="../../../2009/07/precycle-diy-lemon-twist-with-items-from-the-reuse-center/">home-made lemon twist</a>. This year? Massage therapy. My pilates instructor suggested I use a tennis ball to work out the kinks of a tight hamstring I had one day. She told me to sit on a chair, then place the tennis ball under my ouchy hamstring. Gradually moving it down the length of my hamstring. It was like a miracle cure! Tennis balls can also be rolled under a tired bare foot for a little stretch and cheapie foot massage.&#0160; <br/><br/>Do you have any small reuse ideas to share in celebration of EnviroMom&#39;s b-day? Stay tuned this week for some celebratory deals coming your way…&#0160;

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I have spent the past several weeks helping a friend empty the 4,000 square foot home of her in-laws, both of whom passed away last year. I didn&#39;t know this couple who were married for 50-plus years and raised four children together, but I feel connected to them. I&#39;ve been through their closets and cupboards and nooks and crannies, and I&#39;ve listened to my friend tell stories about their happy life together. From this,&#0160;I&#39;ve learned some valuable lessons.</p>
<p><strong>1. Fill your home with quality, durable furniture and household goods.</strong></p>
<p>Now, a 4,000 square foot home is quite a footprint. But it wasn&#39;t filled with stuff pulled off the shelves at a discount store. It was filled with timeless, quality items acquired over a lifetime. I know this because&#0160;a lot of the furniture, decor and other items were taken by the four children for use in their own lives.&#0160;Some&#0160;things were&#0160;given to close friends. But there was <em>plenty</em> of good stuff left over, and that&#39;s where I came in. Rather than hire a couple of guys to haul everything to the dump (which, sadly, is what often happens to the &#39;leftovers&#39; of an estate), my friend and I spent days going room by room and boxing up books, kitchen items, clothing, ornaments, tools&#0160;(an endless, exhaustive list) and categorizing them for various non-profit organizations. Community Warehouse and Volunteers of America filled their trucks with furniture and goods. Dress for Success received several gorgeous Pendleton Woolen Mills&#0160;jackets and some lovely clothing. The list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>2. Clear out the clutter.</strong></p>
<p>This couple&#39;s generation was well-versed in reuse and holding onto every last item &#39;just in case&#39; you need it again. I think this mentality is great...to a point. Saving too much can lead to a lot of clutter, so you need to be realistic and relentless about clearing out what you don&#39;t need (and preferably not acquiring it in the first place!). We sorted bags of non-reusable plastics for&#0160;recycling at Far West Fibers. We combed through files, waded through 50 years of receipts, emptied old seed packets and filled the curbside rollcart with paper.&#0160;We&#0160;filled&#0160;numerous metal coffee cans with scrap metal and boxes with hazardous waste. We recycled and reused absolutely everything we could, until all that was left were items destined for the dump. One dumpster load from 4,000 square feet of house. Pretty amazing.</p>
<p><strong>3.&#0160;Chances are you&#0160;have everything&#0160;you need.</strong></p>
<p>I had every opportunity to take whatever items I wanted for my own use, but I ended up with just a handful of things. Some books, an embroidery hoop, a wool blanket. My friend and I&#0160;discovered that wading through all of this stuff, despite its cool-factor, made us reflect on what we already had and not add to it (more clutter)!&#0160;So whenever we came upon a cool vintage item (so dang tempting!) we&#39;d hold it up and proclaim, &quot;Someone is going to be so happy to find this at the thrift store!&quot;&#0160;For very useful items we&#39;d say, &quot;I don&#39;t really need this, but someone else really does.&quot; It kind of become our mantra. </p>
<p>After spending a day de-cluttering the big house with my friend, we&#39;d both go home and start emptying drawers and cupboards at our own homes. It is so liberating when you know exactly what lives in your house! We both found that neither one of us wants to add any unnecessary stuff to our lives. This whole experience has been such a powerful lesson in stepping back and reevaluating what we have and what we need. A rather morbid question I&#39;ve been asking myself is, &quot;What do I want to leave behind for my children? What can I do now to make the task of clearing out our home a joyful task for my kids?&quot;&#0160;(Hopefully I&#39;ll have&#0160;many more&#0160;years to work on this.) It&#39;s an ongoing process, because it&#39;s pretty&#0160;hard not to not <em>ever</em>&#0160;acquire stuff over a lifetime (particularly with kids).&#0160;But it helps to step back and make acquiring stuff a more&#0160;thoughtful process. I&#39;m sending out a lot of love to the K family for teaching me this valuable lesson!</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Renee posted her <a href="../../../2010/02/easy-homemade-valentines-with-cardboard-and-file-folders/">stinkin&#39; cute heart stamps made from cardboard</a> the other day, and we&#39;ve got a few more crafty-reuse projects to share today. I know it&#39;s really easy to go out and buy a box of Valentine cards for a classroom party, but I figure as long as my kids are enthusiastic about sharing homemade cards with their class, then let&#39;s keep down this path. There will probably come a day when they&#39;ll be horrified at passing out something they&#39;ve drawn. (Sniff.) Plus we already had a hardy supply of cardstock, so might as well use it instead of bringing more paper into our lives. This year, instead of making each individual valentine (which, for us,&#0160;often turns into a chore half-way through), they drew one picture and through the magic of scanning and printing, we ended up with lots:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201287794d86b970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Valentines2010" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e201287794d86b970c image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201287794d86b970c-800wi.jpg" title="Valentines2010"/></a> <br/></p>
<p>They drew their pictures in black ink, and I scanned and mocked them up six to a page in Microsoft Publisher.&#0160;After&#0160;the cards&#0160;were printed the kids colored in the red hearts and addressed them. Easy project, happy kids. Happy mom!</p>
<p>But it&#39;s not to say that more involved projects can&#39;t be just as fun and rewarding. Emily of Industrious Emily and her kids made little Valentine-themed coloring books and homemade crayons for a small group of children. The <a href="http://industriouslyemily.blogspot.com/2010/02/making-crayons.html" target="_blank">crayons were made from bits of old crayons</a>,&#0160;and the <a href="http://industriouslyemily.blogspot.com/2010/02/valentine-coloring-books.html" target="_blank">books were stitched up the middle&#0160;with a sewing machine</a>. Just brilliant! Check out her site for detailed instructions.</p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201287794e235970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a>

<p>I don&#39;t typically spend much time making Valentine&#39;s for my kids -- a quick cut-out heart usually does the trick. But yesterday I spied a project in the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hg/index.ssf/2010/02/create_your_own_3-d_valentine.html" target="_blank">Oregonian&#39;s Home & Garden section</a>&#0160;that looked fun and manageable and involved colorful&#0160;images ripped from an old magazine and whatever patterned paper I could dredge up from the craft stash. For each&#0160;card I traced and cut out six hearts from the magazine and six from&#0160;the paper. Place one magazine heart back-to-back with one paper heart and then stack them all up and stitch them up the middle on the machine using a heavy needle. Gluestick the back-to-back sections of the hearts together (I haven&#39;t done this yet in the photo)&#0160;and fold them along the middle so they 3-Dify. (Far more elegant instructions can be found at that link above.)</p>

<p>My kids are in the next room, forcing me to photograph these in the worst.light.possible. Anyhoodle, it&#39;s a fun project and I think they&#39;ll look cute dangling from&#0160;a chandelier. Best part of these projects? I didn&#39;t need to leave the house.</p>
<p>Happy sweet weekend to all of you!<br/>&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				Planning ahead has never been a strength in this family. Great ideas usually arrive a day late and a dollar short. But not so this year with valentines! We stumbled upon a cute and easy Reduce/Reuse idea for home-made valentines cards thanks to the Martha Steward Living magazine that mysteriously arrived in my mailbox a few weeks back (even thought I&#39;ve not subscribed). Martha&#39;s February issue had many mouthwatering Valentines&#39; Day inspirations, most of which we ignored (out waistlines will thank us later). But we did like an idea she had about making stamps with corrugated cardboard -- hers were little rosettes. We modified her idea and made hearts. Here&#39;s what the stamps look like:<br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2012877783b21970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Carboard-stamps" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e2012877783b21970c image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2012877783b21970c-800wi.jpg" title="Carboard-stamps"/></a> <br/> We used washable Crayola kid paints to ink the stamps (because of course we ended up with paint on our noses to our toes). Once the valentines dried overnight, the kids addressed and signed their cards. Here are some finished cards:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a875e479970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Valentines" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a875e479970b image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a875e479970b-800wi.jpg" title="Valentines"/></a> <br/> Easy peasy. No glitter. No mess. One-of-a-kid valentines. Nothing new or store-bought with characters and smart-alecky sayings. We had plenty of corrugated cardboard in the recycling bin to make our stamps. It did turn out that I had no cardstock for the cards, but we found a wealth of old file folders that were willing to be down-cycled into valentines. <br/><br/>If you have any easy valentines ideas you&#39;d like to share (especially those that Reduce / Reuse materials creatively), please send us a description and a photo. We&#39;ll feature them throughout the week. Let love with a spirit of Reduce / Reuse / Recycle fill the air for this year&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day!

			<div class="entry-body">
				My daughter has a really gunky cough and stuffed up nose. When she blows, it&#39;s like neon green jelly beans shooting out of her nostrils. Gross! TMI! Sorry! I know! (but hey, it&#39;s Friday...)<br/><br/>Here&#39;s the thing. I LOOOOOOVE my stash of old baby wipes. They are the perfect size for nose blowing. One big honk, and toss it in the hamper. There is always a stack of clean wipes ready and waiting for the next blow. I swear, I haven&#39;t bought a box of paper tissues in over a year! And to think that I originally purchased these with full intent to throw them away after one use! Now I shudder to think how many crates we bought over my kids&#39; diaper years and tossed! Eeeeek.<br/><br/>The reuseable wipes are also perfect for face washing. I like that these don&#39;t get super soggy like wash rags, thus don&#39;t drip all over the place. And they dry fast! They are fantastic! I secretly used to love those makeup remover wipes (WAAAAAY before I became an EnviroMom), and now I use these reusable baby wipes instead. It&#39;s the best of both worlds. I use the wipe, then I deposit it in the hamper, with no guilt about throwing something away. I also use them for cleaning. Sometimes even as a napkin. There is no limit as to what can be done with these fantastic reusable wipes! With these wipes I shall rule the world! (cue the evil laugh...) Well, maybe that&#39;s getting carried away.<br/><br/>Mine are the old ones (which we&#39;ve been washing and reusing now for at least 3 years with no sign of wearing out). The <a href="http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=11489346">new baby wipes Kirkland makes have Tencel</a>, so they are marketed as greener, and &#39;biodegradable&#39; (Ooh, I really dislike that kind of claim. Is the average consumer going to biodegrade it? Really?) I swear I saw somewhere that they they are also pitching them as reusable now, but couldn&#39;t find that online. Chime in if you&#39;ve seen that, and if so, is it the same product or more like wash cloths/microfiber cloths? <br/><p>There they are. They don&#39;t look like much. They are a wipe only a mother could love. But love them I do. </p><p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a7fe8aac970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Reuseable-baby-wipes" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a7fe8aac970b image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a7fe8aac970b-800wi.jpg" title="Reuseable-baby-wipes"/></a> <br/> Isn&#39;t it funny what going down the green path lets us fall in love with? I also have a major crush on <a href="../../../vegetarian-dinner-recipes-that-even-kids-like/">lentils</a>, but don&#39;t tell my husband. Please share if you have any quirky green love interests. </p>

<p>Two years ago I posted about <a href="../../../2008/01/diva-love/">my love of the reusable Diva Cup</a>, a&#0160;sort-of &#39;vessel&#39; that catches your flow, which you empty and then reinsert during your period. At the time I was hooked on it. It was totally working for me, and I was thrilled that I was able to eliminate yet another category of disposable products from my life. (The comments from that post are awesomely filled with TMI talk, just to warn you, but folks had some, ahem,&#0160;insertion issues to work out.) Well, about five or six months later I got a Mirena IUD, which has virtually eliminated my period, so I no longer use any type of feminine hygiene. But I&#39;ve been wondering whether anyone has successfully been using reusables for the long term?</p>
<p>To refresh, there are a few reusable options. You&#39;ve got your reusable menstrual cups, like the <a href="http://www.divacup.com/" target="_blank">Diva Cup</a> made from silicone,&#0160;and <a href="http://www.thekeeper.com/" target="_blank">The Keeper</a> made from natural rubber (they also make a silicone version for women allergic to latex). Then there are&#0160;the reusable cloth pads that you wash and wear, like <a href="http://www.gladrags.com/" target="_blank">Glad Rags</a>, <a href="http://www.lunapads.com/" target="_blank">Lunapads</a> and <a href="http://www.etsy.com/search_results.php?search_type=handmade&amp;search_query=cloth+menstrual+pads" target="_blank">homemade varieties</a>&#0160;(or <a href="http://tipnut.com/free-pattern-for-washable-feminine-menstrual-pads/" target="_blank">make your own</a>).&#0160;I would think that cloth diaper users would find this an easy switch. <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/the-red-vadge-of-courage/" target="_blank">Grist did a comparison of various types of&#0160;pads</a> that might be helpful. There are&#0160;also <a href="http://www.greenyour.com/body/personal-care/feminine-hygiene/tips/use-natural-sea-sponge-tampons?subject=9133" target="_blank">sea sponge tampons</a>, made from, yes, sea sponges.&#0160;While these personally have no appeal for me, they seem to <a href="http://crazysquirrellady.blogspot.com/2009/08/product-review-jade-pearl-sea-sponge.html" target="_blank">work just fine for some</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also this whole category of disposable menstrual products made by companies like&#0160;Seventh Generation and Natracare that are unbleached, made with less plastic, made with plant materials, etc. While&#0160;they are still disposable,&#0160;if you are not ready to try&#0160;reusables then I think this is a good way to go (though I haven&#39;t actually tried any so I can&#39;t vouch for effectiveness). Eliminating these nasty ingredients from the manufacturing process (and keeping them away from your tender bits) can only be a positive. However, you should <em>always </em>take &#39;biodegradable&#39; claims with a hefty dose of eye-rolling. If you plan to compost your feminine hygiene in your backyard (and I can offer NO&#0160;insight here!) then the claims apply to you! But in a modern landfill, nothing is breaking down, okay? No air and water is getting in to all of these &#39;biodegradable&#39; products -- they are just hanging out with all of the other garbage, taking up space. If your goal is to reduce waste and&#0160;the harmful emissions related to the production and transport of <em>disposable</em> products, then this is NOT your category of products.</p>
<p>So what are you using, and how long have you been at it? Have you tried and given up on any? Let&#39;s share, ladies.</p>
<p>(And I know that the Mirena does not appeal to everyone because 1) it releases a small amount of hormones into your uterus, and 2) it can be prohibitively expensive if your insurance won&#39;t cover it. It&#39;s a personal choice, my insurance covered it 100% and I&#0160;love it.)</p>
