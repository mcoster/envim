		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>So, a friend came over the other day with his dog. My kids were looking at the dog's fancy leash: it had a little built-in holder for doggie-doo bags. I love it when dog owners are responsible and pick up after their pets. With a bit of pride, my friend announced that the doggie doo bags are biodegradable. </p>
<p>Apparently, we're all supposed to ooh-and-aah at that point. It's <strong>Biodegradable!</strong> The magic word. Right up there with: natural! photodegradable! recyclable! environmentally friendly! green! earth-friendly!</p>
<p>But being the smarty-pants Master Recycler that I am, I asked &quot;So, does that mean you're composting the poop?&quot; He gave me a look like I was utterly insane. He's not a real nature guy, and spends a lot of time shopping in the Pearl District. No, you guessed it. He tosses them in the garbage, and the bag of poop goes to the landfill where it sure doesn't biodegrade.</p>
<p>So here's what I wanted to say: &quot;Dude, you just spent good money on biodegradable plastic bags that you're not even composting? In case you haven't noticed, you can get plastic bags for free. I guess the bright side of it is you at least got a matching dog leash to go with your expensive bags.&quot;</p>
<p>Apologies for my fixation on excrement this week. I can't seem to move past it. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I can't believe we did it (doing a little dance)! When the SW GreenGroup met for the first time back in March I said that one of my goals was to whittle down our garbage service to once a month. Yesterday I made the phone call to my hauler! Starting next week my four-member family will only put out our 32 gallon garbage can on the first Friday of the month, though we will still have weekly recycling and bi-weekly yard debris pick-up. Our bill dropped from $24/month down to $14/month. Here are the baby steps we took to get there:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Started composting food scraps.</strong> I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best method for our family and ultimately went with a <a href="../../../2007/05/food_scrap_comp/">homemade version of the Earth Machine</a> (which I've since supplemented with a real Earth Machine). I also bought a pretty stainless steel under-counter compost bin for the kitchen, but recently ran out of carbon filters for it. Since I keep forgetting to buy replacements I've been using a big Tupperware-type container instead, and it works just as well. </li>
<li><strong>Started vigorously recycling plastic containers and bags</strong> by taking advantage of the <a href="../../../2007/09/get-ready-the-p/">Master Recycler Plastic Round-ups</a> and making occasional trips to <a href="../../../2007/05/a_virtual_visit/">Far West Fibers</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Stopped buying paper towels and napkins</strong>. Now we use <a href="../../../2007/04/baby_step_use_c/">cloth napkins</a> and a stack of washcloths and tea towels in lieu of paper towels. </li>
<li><strong>Potty-trained my son!</strong> Disposable diapers definitely filled up a huge part of our can every week. </li>
<li><strong>Reduced the amount of 'convenience foods' purchased at the grocery store</strong>. Lots of these things can't be recycled like string cheese wrappers, cereal box liners, Goldfish bags and ice cream cartons (wah). I started buying more items in bulk like granola, trail mix and nuts and reusing plastic bags each time I go to the store.</li></ul>
<p>It took six months to get there, but we made some serious lifestyle adjustments, which you just can't rush. Next goals? Reducing the amount of plastic we buy and going car-free two days (or more) a week. Stay tuned...</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2007/08/the-future-of-c/">The future of curbside recycling in Portland</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There has been quite a lot of media coverage on the <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/osd/index.cfm?c=45143&amp;">plan to revamp Portland's curbside recycling program</a>, so it was kind of a shock to meet so many people over the weekend that weren't aware that any changes are in our future. Renee and I had a dual EnviroMom and <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler</a> booth at Multnomah Days and met just a ton of people who were interested in green cleaners, hazardous waste disposal, recycling and many other green issues. We found ourselves explaining the recently-approved plan to many people, which is actually what we're trained to do as Master Recyclers! In a nutshell, here's what is ahead for residential curbside recycling (or click <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/osd/index.cfm?c=45144&amp;">here</a> for the actual plan):</p>
<p>In 2008-2009 residents will be given two rollcarts: one for yard debris (versus using your own container) and one for recycling. The items you can recycle will be increased to include plastic tubs and plant pots. Glass recyclables will still be kept on the side in a separate bin. The reason they are moving to these rollcarts is to both simplify recycling for residents (no more sorting) and because they will use different trucks to collect recyclables (the kind with the claw that dumps the rollcart versus workers doing the heavy lifting). Other changes will include more public recycling events (plastic round-ups, etc.), requiring haulers to communicate more effectively with their customers and developing emmission standards for garbage trucks.</p>
<p>In 2009-2015 Portland residents should see curbside food scrap composting added to garbage service. Food scraps will go in with yard debris (including meat and dairy, and possibly pizza boxes and paper towels!) and will be picked up once per week. Garbage will then be picked every other week. <a href="http://www.cedar-grove.com/">Cedar Grove</a>, which turns yard debris and food scraps into compost for the Seattle area is scouting locations in Portland and will hopefully be up and running by 2009. Cedar Grove then packages and sells the compost back to area residents for use in landscaping! (Ah, the circle is complete.)</p>
<p>As the city gets closer to implementing the changes there will be a huge educational outreach, and we'll be hearing a lot more about these fantastic changes. Hooray! </p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Recently Gwen moved to Portland from an 80-acre farm outside of Charlottesville, VA where she did lots of&nbsp; &quot;green&quot; things, including a chemical free garden, composting, and just being outside a lot since the farm was their backyard. Now she is wanting to compost on a small scale:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I have a quick question for you, I live in an apartment community and don't have an option for composting large scraps like corn and watermelon.&nbsp; I would love to compost, but don't know what to do with my goodies.&nbsp; I feel so horrible everytime I have to throw veggie and fruit parts away.&nbsp; Do you know of any good options for me?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Does anyone have a similar challenge or any ideas for Gwen? Gwen is also interested in being a part of a GreenGroup in the NW-Portland area. Anyone else?</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.metro-region.org/article.cfm?articleid=149">Blue Lake Regional Park</a> now boasts a natural discovery garden located next to the water spray ground. Here's what the latest <a href="http://www.metro-region.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=163">Metro Solid Waste and Recycling Newsletter</a> has to say about it:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Children and grownups can experience the wonders of nature while learning how to garden naturally and organically. The garden is loaded with many plants to see, smell and touch. Many of them are native to the region, like huckleberry and coastal strawberry. Others include non-invasive exotics like chocolate cosmos and pineapple sage. All of the plants were selected to require little, if any, water, fertilizers and pesticides. The garden also features a compost exploration area, a digging area and a worm bin. In addition, two rain gardens capture water from the roof of a log gazebo to prevent pollution in our storm drain system and local rivers. The gazebo provides seating and shade, and large boulders and logs offer fun climbing opportunities for kids.</p></blockquote><p>In addition, Metro is offering a free Worm Composting seminar this Saturday, August 18 at Blue Lake from 11am to noon. Children are welcome to attend, but call Metro to register first: 503-234-3000.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Hope is wondering how green under-sink garbage disposals are:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Ok, so I'm going to the experts here, what's the word on under-sink garbage disposals?&nbsp; Other than diapers, a lot of our garbage seems to be table scraps that can't be composted.&nbsp; We're thinking of remodelling our kitchen next year and I was wondering if it would be good to include a garbage disposal into the plan.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; Thanks!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You are too kind to call us experts, Hope. But here's my understanding of the situation with a little help from the <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recyclers</a> and Portland Environmental Services' &quot;After the Flush&quot; publication. According to Lauren, the master recycler coordinator, &quot;The majority of the roughage, or
more fiberous material (if you will) is filtered immediately at the
treatment plant and sent to the landfill.&nbsp; The majority of this is
paper, but some of the food from the disposal will also be filtered
here. So it is the same problem: it ends up at the landfill. However,
this first screen is fairly wide and I would say some of the food
(especially if you have an efficient disposal) will get through this
filter. It will then be put through several levels of physical or
biological filters that end up then being used as compost in Eastern
Oregon.&nbsp; So, it is better than just throwing it away as it has a chance
of being composted via the sewer system.&quot; Additionally, Lauren adds &quot;I get the impression that Portland is unique
in composting our waste from sewers. I would bet that most
jurisdictions are landfilling.&quot;</p>
<p>I've posted about <a href="../../../2007/03/after_the_flush/">how informative the &quot;After the Flush&quot; brochure is</a>, especially to kids who enjoy anything with a high grossness factor. For all intents and purposes, any wastewater or solids in the sewers, whether from flushing toilets or kitchen drains/disposals all goes through the same process. So does the garbage disposal get the thumbs up or down? Kinda depends on where you live. I'd suggest you compost as much as you can at home as a first step because then you know with certainty what is happening to it.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/OSD/index.cfm?c=edafc">Portland Metro will very likely expand the recycling options of home-owners in the next two years</a>. Hopefully we'll soon be putting kitchen scraps out for composting in curbside bins as they currently do in Seattle and San Francisco. It does remain to be seen what scraps will be included.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Ah plastic. Cheap, lightweight, durable, and versatile. What more could you want? Well, in these greening times, many ask for <a href="http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2006/august/pla.php">biodegradeablilty.</a> There's now biodegradeable plastic water bottles, takeout containers, grocery bags. But is it the right answer? Most of the experts we've met in the <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler</a> class would give you a resounding &quot;no.&quot; The reasons are many:</p>
<ul><li>Biodegradeable plastics don't always degrade very well, especially photo biodegradeable plastics</li>
<li>If you compost them, they really don't add anything good to the compost, and probably leave behind some plastic </li>
<li>They are a major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_bag">contaminant in the recycling stream</a> of petroleum-based plastics</li></ul>
<p>My vote: biodegradeable plastics are a curse. They muddy the waters. They allow us to think we're making green choices when we're really just sticking to the unhealthy habits of our throw-away culture. It's all the more reason to bring your own cloth bags (or reuse store bags until they fall apart), fill your own reuseable water bottle, and bring your own takeout containers too. Avoid getting into another argument along the lines of paper vs. plastic (biodegradeable plastics vs. recyclable petroleum-based plastics - doesn't really roll off the tongue the way &quot;paper vs. plastic&quot; does). So what do you think?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br/>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2007/05/food_scrap_comp/">A solution to the food composting dilemma!</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1066,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/05/dscn0093.jpg"><img title="Dscn0093" height="233" alt="Dscn0093" src="../../../images/2007/05/05/dscn0093.jpg" width="175" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> Well, after weeks of researching and slightly obsessing over the perfect method for composting our food scraps, I actually came up with a very simple one. First, I bought my kitchen scrap bucket. I ended up with the stainless steel composter from <a href="http://www.kitchenkapers.com/stainsteelco2.html">Endurance</a>. It holds one gallon and has a carbon filter in the lid. I was able to store five days worth of scraps (vegetable, fruit, egg shells and coffee grounds) with zero smell. Plus, it's so pretty that I don't mind if it sits on the counter. I also like its small size and you can put it in the dishwasher if it gets too mucky. (Bought it at Sur La Table in the Pearl for $46.)</p>
<p>For the outdoor composter, I took one of our Rubbermaid yard debris cans and drilled a bunch of 1/4 inch holes in the bottom for drainage and organism access, and a few more around the sides for air flow. This idea came to me after realizing that the <a href="http://www.metro-region.org/article.cfm?articleid=557">Earth Machine</a> was a good solution for someone (me) whose primary goal was keeping food out of the landfill (because it releases methane) and not so much to actually make compost. After looking at the Earth Machine, I realized I could tweak a garbage can to function in a similar manner, though it doesn't have the little trap door at the bottom to get the compost out. Not a problem. Also, a presenter in our Master Recycler class (yea!) told us that he had put his Earth Machine on his concrete driveway for four years, and while he put food scraps in it regularly, he never took anything out and he never filled it up. The stuff just kept decomposing down and down. Perfect.<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/05/dscn0095_2.jpg"><img title="Dscn0095_2" height="131" alt="Dscn0095_2" src="../../../images/2007/05/05/dscn0095_2.jpg" width="175" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px"/></a> </p>
<p>I learned that you need to keep a balance of food and yard waste in your composter so that it doesn't stink and it breaks down properly. <a href="http://www.metro-region.org/article.cfm?articleid=553">There are many theories on this</a>, but a 50-50 blend of green (food, grass, fresh leaves) to brown (dead leaves, straw) is safe. Since we had neglected to rake up our fall leaves last year (woo hoo!), I had plenty to gather, so I piled them into another yard debris can for easy access when I dump in the food scraps. (The black one is the composter and the green one holds the leaves.) They are tucked behind a rhody close to the house so on rainy days I have no excuses (ha). </p>
<p>Also, an FYI: one of the biggest complaints about the Earth Machine is that rodents can easily get into it because of the open bottom. Well, hold on to your carrot tops, because they've created a perforated bottom made of durable plastic that should keep the critters out. It costs $7. You can buy it and the Earth Machines at the <a href="http://www.metro-region.org/article.cfm?articleid=557">Metro Paint Retail Facility</a>.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Time for a little democracy in action as pertains to curbside pickup. The City of Portland is seeking public comment on the draft Portland Recycles! Plan from May 1 to June 15, 2007. If you did not see the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1177991706263530.xml&amp;coll=7">plan outlined in the Oregonian this week</a>, big changes are in store including:</p>
<ul><li>Trading up our yellow bins for big ol' blue rollcarts to increase the quantity of recyclables the city can collect from us each week</li>
<li>Changing from sorted recyclables to commingled (mixed)</li>
<li>Curbside pickup of kitchen scraps -- stuff you're hopefully feeding your worms right now</li>
<li>Weekly pickup of yard debris (instead of every other week)</li></ul> <p><a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/osd/index.cfm?c=43052">Comment online</a> or make your voice heard at a public meeting:</p>
<p><strong>Proposed commercial waste system changes:</strong></p>
