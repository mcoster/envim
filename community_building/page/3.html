					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2008/03/reclaiming-dinn/">Reclaiming dinnertime</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Please forgive us if we start to sound like the apostles of Michael Pollan. Heather and I both recently read <em>In Defense of Food</em>,
and it really rocked our food worlds. My husband is now reading my
copy, so hopefully he'll soon be clear on why I've been suggesting so
many changes around eating time lately. </p>
<p>A few days ago, I called for a family meeting after dinner. The kids
feared they were in trouble, and that I was going to lay down the law
on various things. We were all starving hungry that night, and crabby,
so we ate first, then talked. It gave me time to figure out what
exactly I wanted to talk about, instead of just going on a rant. We
ultimately began by discussing everything that needs to happen to get
dinner onto the table every night. My 6-year-old loved it: raising her
hand to answer just about every question I asked:</p>
<ul><li>Who goes to the store to buy the food?</li>
<li>Who cooks the food?</li>
<li>Who sets the table?</li>
<li>Who pours the drinks?</li>
<li>Who does the dishes?</li>
<li>Who has to beat the children off with a stick saying: &quot;dinner's not
ready yet, we have to wait until your daddy gets home, and no you can't
have a snack right before we sit down the dinner&quot;?</li></ul>
<p>In our family, the correct answer to all the questions is: mom. Yes,
me. How did that happen? I don't think of myself as anything more than
a competent cook, and I'm not a control freak. But somehow I've fallen
into a trap of thinking that's its easier to get it done without the
children under foot... So we decided after our meeting to make some
changes. The kids are now in charge of setting the table, pouring the
drinks and helping carry their plates to the table and to the sink
after mealtime. It takes a lot of prompting. Next phase, the kids need
to be more involved in the choosing what we eat and cooking as well. <br/>
 </p>
<p>Now, I'm not ready to have our kids start <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2008/02/welcome-to-the.html">eating all of our meals in the dining room like Heather has</a>
(mostly for fear of too much spilled milk on the nice rug). But I will
say that increasing everyone's involvement has taken some of the
pressure off of me, and has magically gotten us more connected at
dinnertime. I was under a false impression that because we always sat
down to eat together, that we had that battle won. What I didn't
realize was that it doesn't really count if everyone's just eating and
talking, but not really listening and relating. We even said a little
prayer of gratitude after our meal, which the kids really seemed to
like. </p>
<p>How involved are your children in preparing, serving and cleaning up after meals? Do you pray or give thanks at each meal? Do you feel your family savors the food and family time connecting at meals, or is there room for improvement at your table?<br/> </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter">bartering</a> is often considered a thing of the past, it's starting to become my favorite way to strike a deal. Saturday night, while talking about sewing, a friend offered to babysit <em>both of my kids</em> for several hours if I'd hem up some pants for her. Are you kidding? Deal! My husband is also no stranger to bartering. He's one of those Mac gurus, and often gets roped into helping friends and family with technical difficulties. To him their technical difficulties are easy. So a few hours of desktop support equals a few hours of babysitting our darling little moppets. Can you tell what our currency would be called if it ever came to that? MasterCard, Visa or will you be using your Babysit card? I also recently repaired a hook on a friend's bra that got all messed up in the washing machine. She's sworn to use a lingerie bag next time, and the fix was easy-peasy for me. Plus, given how expensive bras are, you can't just throw the baby out with the bathwater if you know what I mean. This was so super easy, I actually just volunteering to do it, no strings attached, but she did offer to loan me her Walt Disney World guide when they get back from a family vacation this month (as we are going there in July). Gosh I love bartering. Don't you?</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2008/02/greening-up-a-p/">Greening up a playgroup: taking it a step further</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Heather posted a bit ago about <a href="../../../2008/01/how-to-green-up/">how to green up a playgroup</a>. Mostly we discussed ways to limit waste in the food and drink aspects of playgroups. We were thinking a little further about the topic, and came up with additional suggestions if you wanted to make &quot;green goals&quot; a part of your playgroup's focus. Here are some of the activities that could be integrated:</p>
<ul><li>Organizing <a href="../../../2007/09/naked-baby-part/">swaps</a> on a regular basis, that could include clothing, diapers, gear, books, toys, games, puzzles, etc. It'll teach kids about the value of reuse, and that swapping can be just as much fun as shopping for new, since they'll come home with stuff that's new to them.</li>
<li>Farm and food field trips: u-pick farms for seasonal fruits. Getting back in touch with our food supply! Follow up with a canning party. Heather, our friend April and I <a href="../../../2007/10/making-apple-bu/">canned apple butter</a> last fall. It was a blast, and we've been enjoying delicious apple butter all winter.</li>
<li>Pool resources: <a href="../../../2008/02/jumping-back-in/">join a CSA with a bunch of friends and share recipes</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../2007/04/greengroup_fiel/">Have home field trips/teach-ins</a>: share what you know about composting, permaculture, canning, raising urban chickens, etc. with your playgroup in the hope that it will inspire others to try these things in their homes. You can also brainstorm on solutions for green living challenges. </li>
<li>Pool and share magazine subscriptions. If one of you gets <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/11/reading-fun-wit.html">Tessy & Tab</a>, another Highlights, and another Nick Jr., you can all read and pass along magazines after you've finished, so that everyone shares one copy instead of each subscribing individually.</li>
<li>Have a sewing bee, or a knitting bee: Teach what you know about knitting to your groups of friends, or teaching how to darn socks, mend clothing or patch the knees of jeans. Or get together with friends to <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/12/season-of-givin.html">sew cloth gift bags</a> before the holiday season to reduce paper waste. </li>
<li>Everyone pitch in with some ingredients and <a href="../../../2007/08/making-green-cl/">mix up home-made household &quot;greener cleaners&quot;</a> with castile soap, glycerine, vinegar, water, etc. Kind of like a science experiment, and you get to take home your share of what is made.<br/> </li></ul>
<p>Do you have any green activity ideas that you can add to this list?</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last year I donated to a few non-profits via <a href="http://giveguide.oaktree.com/">Willamette Week's Give!Guide!</a> and loved how easy it was. It's like online shopping: they have 49 non-profits from which to choose. Just select the ones you want, the amount you want to donate to each one and put it on your card. The hard part is deciding which ones to choose. Habitat for Humanity? Urban Gleaners? Schoolhouse Supplies? Growing Gardens? Community Cycling Center? All of these organizations work for our community, and the kicker check is coming...</p>
<p>(Oh, and you get a whole bunch of cool stuff for donating money: Tazo Tea, free Flexcar membership, a cuppa joe from Stumptown Coffee, and discounts from local retailers. Sweet.)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>You'll find this hard to believe but sometimes I am at a loss for words. Like the time I was having a deep pro-environment discussion with a friend who then floored me by saying she can't be bothered to bring an empty disposable water bottle home with her for recycling: it was just so much easier to throw it away in the nearest trash can.&nbsp; (My thought bubble would have read something like this: Is that empty bottle so heavy that you can't be bothered to lug it around? Now that it's 16-ounces lighter after you consumed the water?) Really. I was speechless.</p>
<p>But then, I guess speechlessness can be a good thing. Most people can't stand a know-it-all, and won't abide being preached at. I figure enough of my cohorts know I write this blog with Heather, and if they want to hear what I'm talking about, they'll tune in. Otherwise, I try to keep my mouth shut, but keep doing what I've learned to do: compost, use durable goods, precycle/resist consumption, etc. </p>
<p>And sometimes role modeling seems to make an impression on people you thought might be unreachable: the friend who starts using durable grocery bags after a lifetime of seemingly stockpiling the plastic ones like there was no tomorrow; or the friend who asks out of the blue how we compost because she's thinking her family might start. Sometimes it feels like all the baby steps and tiny changes don't really make a difference when all around there is still so much denial, consumption and waste. Then there are these little glimmers of hope. Keep doing the green things, because some people are noticing and impressed enough by your efforts to make a change in their own lives.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2007/08/neighbors-for-t/">Neighbors for the Environment -- excellent example of community-building</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When Renee and I had our EnviroMom/Master Recycler booth at Multnomah Days we were lucky to have a great group of folks in the booth next door: <a href="http://pdxnfte.org/index.html">Neighbors for the Environment</a> (NFTE or 'nifty'). NFTE was inspired by the <a href="http://www.nwei.org/NWEI/Home.html">Northwest Earth Institute</a> and essentially encourages neighbors to form groups (much like our <a href="../../../greengroups/index/">GreenGroups</a>) to discuss ways to address global climate change. They currently list four groups on their Web site (all in SW) and will list any new groups that crop up. In addition to meetings, some of the activities NFTE suggests are neighborhood work parties, cooperative recycling, emergency preparedness plans, tool sharing and car pooling.</p>
<p>Doesn't that sound ideal? Do you hang out with your neighbors, pool resources and help out one another? Isn't that the way it should be? (We've become such an insular society.) All it would take is a note in a mailbox, or stopping to chat when a neighbor is working in the yard, and you could create a neighborhood support system. Sounds great to me (now if only we could transition to 29-hour days...).</p>
