				<p>This is version 8.0.1 of the <a href="../../../2008/03/sweating-the-sm/">natural deodorant chronicles</a>. It&#39;s so hard not to sweat the small stuff!!</p><p>My mom was just visiting, and since she hails from Hawaii and feels a chill when the temp dips below 70, we kept our heat a bit higher than usual during her stay. High for us is ice cold for most, so don&#39;t get me wrong. I probably put the heat up to 66 degrees only a few times. And if you turned around after my husband said something tricky like &#39;Hey! Look out the window! Flying pink dinosaurs drinking margaritas!!&#39; he&#39;d override my heat setting and drop it down to 55 before you even realized there were no extinct creatures or adult beverages to be seen. </p><p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a6a8dc08970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> <br/> In any case, <a href="../../../2008/06/experiment-usin/">tea tree oil, which has anointed my pits</a> for months, and has done a fairly heroic job of keeping my pits not overly stinky... failed me repeatedly this past week. So you might have spied me doing some clandestine pit sniffing all day yesterday after I dabbed on baking soda with a powder puff straight up. I had heard about this ages ago, but feared it would be too gritty or sandy feeling. Not so. Didn&#39;t feel any different than a body powder. So I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s the new pit sauce, er, powder. I&#39;ll report back once I&#39;ve given it more than a day&#39;s test drive.</p><p>Oh, and I want to say I was motivated to try this after reading an email from <a href="http://fakeplasticfish.com/">Beth Terry, of Fake Plastic Fish fame</a>, who said she&#39;s a tried and true fan but one time did get a tiny bit of grief from airport security about the unmarked white power in her luggage. </p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a68ab1d6970c-pi" style="float: left;"></a> I am generally leery of campaigns led by business entities to raise awareness of a cause. Oftentimes it just feels like a marketing campaign for the company itself. Which it is, I guess, but this one actually feels OK to me. Seventh Generation&#0160;has teamed with&#0160;<a href="http://www.saferchemicals.org/" target="_blank">Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families</a>&#0160;to host a virtual <a href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com/million-baby-crawl/" target="_blank">Million Baby Crawl</a> in an effort to get&#0160;Congress to pass a law banning toxic chemicals in household products. Essentially, they want you to sign up to support their effort and encourage your family and friends to do the same. To do this, you <a href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com/million-baby-crawl/" target="_blank">visit their Web site</a> and create a crawler. (You don&#39;t actually have to have a baby to participate. It&#39;s a virtual crawler.) You give them your name and email address, and then you can direct friends and family to support your crawler by signing up, too. It&#39;s a gimmick -- they&#39;re trying to gather names (which hopefully will only be used as ammunition when presented to Congress) but sometimes you need a gimmick to get people involved. </p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to sit here at the keyboard and lament toxic products&#0160;and feel like&#0160;I&#39;m powerless to make change. I have no idea how to make change on this kind of level, so I&#39;m grateful when&#0160;someone else&#0160;is willing to take the reins and push for it. Yes, of course, Seventh Generation would ultimately benefit from this kind of anti-toxin legislation -- they&#39;re in the business of non-toxic products! But we all would benefit, too.</p>
<p>So, I signed up. This I can do from my keyboard. You can <a href="http://www.seventhgeneration.com/million-baby-crawl/?id=8877" target="_blank">support my crawler</a>&#0160;or someone else&#39;s or make your own. In addition, events will be held around the country to generate local support and awareness. There&#39;s one in the Portland metro area on Wednesday, November 18 from 10am-2pm at the Washington Square Mall. Stop by, sign a petition and make your voice heard.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Heather and I put on our best <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Brockman">Kent Brockman</a> voices a week ago, when we talked with all the second graders at our elementary school, saying &quot;You might remember us from the &#39;<a href="../../../2008/05/kindergarteners/">Reduce/Reuse/Recycle&#39; presentation</a> we gave while you were in kindergarten...&quot; I don&#39;t think any of them picked up on the Simpsons reference. But all in all, it was a good talk. You gotta love kids for their unbridled enthusiasm!</p><p>While prepping for our talk, I re-watched <a href="http://storyofstuff.com/">Annie Leonard&#39;s fantastic video The Story of Stuff.</a> If it&#39;s been a while, you really should carve out 20 minutes to sit down and watch it. I probably looked a lot like an over enthusiastic sports fan while watching this video: Eyes glues to my computer screen. Shouting out spontaneous bursts of support: &quot;Yeah!&quot; &quot;You go, girl!&quot; and the triumphant hissed &quot;Yes!!!&quot; It was good no one else was home to overhear me. A few things from the video jumped out at me this time:</p><ul>
<li>About manufacturing... We put good stuff and toxic stuff together, resulting in stuff that gets thrown away quickly, but with it all now being toxic stuff. Yesterday&#39;s thread about the <a href="../../../2009/10/envirobits-swedish-labeling-bpa-in-canning-lids-and-my-love-for-mark-bittman/">BPA in canning lids underlines this point</a>. There&#39;s also warnings this year about how <a href="http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id=584">most Halloween face paints contain lead, cobalt, nickel and chromium</a>. This makes me want to scream! I consider myself fairly informed, but imagine there are tons of moms out there who don&#39;t know and really want to cute their kids up for Halloween by painting their faces. Arghhhh!!! The <a href="http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id=233#halloween">Campaign for Safe Cosmetics offers some recipes for safer DIY face paints</a>.</li>
<li>The other thing that jumped at me was about fashion and how we watch tv and feel bad about ourselves, and we go out shopping to feel better, and we buy some stuff, and we go to work to pay for the stuff... Yet, if we resist, we end up being the mom with skinny heels in a &#39;fat heels year&#39; and the TV blares &quot;You suck!&quot; I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m above all that. But truthfully, I do often feel like the most unstylish, un-chic person in every crowd. Oh well. But I do find I watch less TV, which happened very gradually over time as I had less and less time (probably the TV time loss can be attributed to the amount of time I spend blogging). So I&#39;m exposed to less advertising, which is good so the chants of &quot;You suck!&quot; don&#39;t get overwhelming.&#0160;</li>
</ul>
Re-watch The Story of Stuff. And be strong. We don&#39;t suck. I&#39;m Kent Brockman, signing off...

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2009/10/cork-placemats-just-as-durable-as-plastic/">Cork placemats: just as durable as plastic</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a61302bd970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a> <br/> </p>
<p>A few months ago, after we finished our <a href="../../../2009/07/the-mostlybutnotentirely-green-kitchen-remodel/">kitchen recession remodel</a>, I went in search of round placemats for our new round kitchen table. Since I intend to keep this table for the rest of my days, I want to keep it in good shape. We never used placemats on our old, battered 50&#39;s dinette, so I&#39;ve been out of the placemat loop for the past decade. (Placemat loop?) I figured I&#39;d find some sort of cloth mats, but to my delight found cork placemats at Crate & Barrel marked down to $3 a piece (and it doesn&#39;t look like they carry them anymore). I was a little hesitant. Would they stain? Would they crumble? It&#39;s one thing to purchase an item made of a sustainable material, but if it doesn&#39;t hold up then it&#39;s not really&#0160;sustainable, right?</p>
<p>Well, four months later I&#39;m happy to report that these placemats totally rock. They look as good as they did brand-new. No rips, no crumbling, no drink rings, and the food wipes right off. They are cushiony and&#0160;naturally resistant to mold and mildew. I love that I don&#39;t have to keep throwing them in the wash like I might with a fabric mat. Vinyl mats wipe clean, too, but I just could not go there. These are such an excellent alternative. Now I&#39;m planning to line some of our drawers with cork (since I didn&#39;t have enough <a href="../../../2009/06/ecofriendly-shelf-paper/">Marmoleum remnants</a> to do all of the kitchen) and will skip the <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/sku4450524/" target="_blank">pricey version</a> in favor of cork rolls from a craft or hardware store (thanks for that idea, Rachele).</p>
<p>From what I&#39;ve read online, cork is a natural renewable resource, and it is harvested by stripping the bark from cork trees. It&#0160;doesn&#39;t harm the trees and it grows back. The downside is that the trees&#0160;only grow in Europe,&#0160;primarily Portugal, so cork travels a ways to get here. But don&#39;t most products travel a ways to get here? Not a good argument, I know, but it&#39;s all I&#39;ve got right now.</p>
<p>Any good cork success/failure stories to share? What are you using for placemats? Any good crafty reuse ideas out there for making your own?</p>

				<p>For years now, I&#39;ve looked into all the various nooks and crannies of our home and lifestyle and tried to devise ways to be greener: less driving, switching to non-toxic cleaners, the battle to keep the garbage output very low and the reuse/recycling efforts very high. With myself and the kids, I&#39;ve switched out just about every personal care product: sunscreen, lip balm, shampoo/conditioner, soaps, moisturizing lotions. So far, my husband has been off-limits. But no more. Sorry honey. It&#39;s time for your green makeover in personal care products. </p><p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a5e582f9970b-pi" style="float: right;"></a> When I discovered the news about <a href="../../../2009/09/plastic-in-exfoliating-scrubs-grrr-what-will-they-foist-on-us-next/">plastic in exfoliating scrubs</a>, it prompted me to read more product labels in our bathroom. The most chemical-laden, scary-sounding ingredients are on the labels of the shampoo my husband uses, his shaving cream and pit sauce. There they are: Lined up against the wall as if they were about to face a firing squad. Well, you are! Be very scared. The green color of that shampoo bottle even looks toxic! Your days are so totally numbered!!</p><p>Then, in what has become a fairly typical situation for me, I go to the store, stare at all the &#39;natural&#39; brands for a while. I pick some up. I wonder if they&#39;re any good. I put them down. Then I walk away without buying anything. So he keeps using the stuff at home. It&#39;s a good thing he doesn&#39;t have to shave very often.&#0160;</p><p>Do tell, if you will, dear EnviroMom readers... What frothy cream assists in the shaving of the hairy scruff that grows on your husband&#39;s face? Which shampoo and/or conditioner washes his hair? And lastly, which stick, crystal or potion fights the beastly smells that emanate from his manly armpits?</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a62497f7970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Fruitflies002" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a62497f7970c image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a62497f7970c-800wi.jpg" title="Fruitflies002"/></a> <br/> Pardon me as I go into Cliff Clavin mode...but it&#39;s a little known fact that fruit flies, those pesky bugs that seem to spontaneously generate whenever fresh produce enters the house, have&#0160;roughly a&#0160;<a href="http://www.fi.edu/tfi/units/life/living/living.html" target="_blank">seven-day life cycle</a>. This means that when a piece of produce comes into your home, it could contain fruit fly eggs, which rapidly metamorphosize into an actual fly,&#0160;which then immediately lays more eggs before its swift,&#0160;untimely death a few days later. They are fast and furious breeders and have no time to nurture long lasting relationships with their children (sniff)! Fruit flies can enter your home on produce, or through a screen (yes, even very fine mesh) or cracks in your home. They have a <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-fruit-flies-and-where-do-they-come-from.htm" target="_blank">wicked sense of smell</a> and can detect the alcohol&#0160;in fruit from far off. Therefore, to prevent an infestation it&#39;s a good idea to try to knock &#39;em out when you first see one.</p>
<p>I&#39;d only ever tried the futile hand-clap method to get rid of fruit flies until I read about another one in the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/foodday/" target="_blank">Oregonian&#39;s FOODday</a> section (the print version, ahem).&#0160;And yes! It actually works.:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>Put a little cider vinegar in a small bowl or jar, along with a piece of fruit. (I used an apple core.)&#0160;Cover it tightly with a piece of plastic and poke a few small holes in the plastic with a toothpick.&#0160;The flies will be attracted to the smell and will&#0160;find their way in, but won&#39;t be able to get out. Some will drown. When you&#39;ve caught a few dump them outside (in your compost bin!) and do it again until you are fruit-fly free.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I wonder if I can get Norm to buy me a beer. Cheers!</p>

Muttering to myself. Jotting down notes. Adding things up in my head. The book is the Azure Standard catalog. Why the intense study of it? I feel like I&#39;ve got to make it work. I&#39;ve been ordering off and on from this Oregon-based wholesaler for over a year, and so far, much to my chagrin, it hasn&#39;t really been a love connection. <br/><br/>In case you&#39;re unfamiliar with it, <a href="http://www.azurestandard.com/">Azure Standard</a> carries a wide variety of natural and organic foods and household items. They supply many eco-friendly grocery stores -- selling bulk quantities for bins, cases of stuff and really big restaurant supply quantities of some items. What&#39;s cool is they let us end users buy in this bulk capacity as well. Some people swear by this grocery delivery service, and do most of their shopping here. I&#39;d kind of hoped I could achieve that. At least it could become <a href="../../../2007/06/encourage_costc/">my new Costco after I stopped shopping there</a>. At the very least, I could get my recycled content toilet paper by the case. In reality, that&#39;s about the most I&#39;ve ever ordered so far. Oh, I&#39;ve split a 25-pound box of granola with Heather a few times. And I got a few of those jugs of organic maple syrup. But that&#39;s a far cry from doing the majority of my grocery shopping there as some of my friends manage to do every month! (Here you&#39;ll find me bowing to your superiority! You know who you are.)<br/><br/>

</p> I am not a dedicated cleaner, so when I do put effort into cleaning, I want to do it well in the hope that I can then walk away and not have to clean again for a good year or so. Rarely works, though. I also feel like I&#39;ve been brainwashed quite thoroughly by the American consumer mindset to believe that I need tailored products for each specific cleaning job. Something not working? Go and buy a better product! Do you do this too?<p>Case in point. I was quizzing friends over the summer about what they use to clean wood. I didn&#39;t get many answers. So I asked my new BFF Google and got some options. I set my heart on a Mrs. Meyers All Purpose cleaning product for the simple reason that it said it cleans wood and I didn&#39;t have any, and I really wanted to buy something from Mrs. Meyers since many people seem to just love her! Then I thought about it a little bit. I realized I had another natural brand of all purpose cleaner already, and I should at least try that first. How different could it be? Truth be told, I wasn&#39;t thrilled. I like the stuff well enough for many jobs, but it wasn&#39;t cleaning off all the greasy fingerprints my darling children had left on the wood dining room chairs. I&#39;m glad I had resisted the urge to go out and buy something new. Who knows if the Mrs. Meyers brand would have worked any better on wood. </p><p>What I did do next is consult the infamous home-keeping diva of America. Yes, Martha. And do you know what she suggested? It&#39;s brilliant in its simplicity (and I probably gave it away from my post title): dish soap. I squirted a little dish soap (the kind for hand-washing dishes vs. the automatic dishwasher kind) onto a wet rag. Voila! Greasy paw prints gone! Now I need not fear feeding my kids egg-rolls at the dining room table ever again. There is hope! There is cleanliness! There is justice and goodness in the world! (OK. I&#39;ll stop now). And I didn&#39;t need to buy anything special or new.&#0160;</p><p>But wait! There&#39;s more! (OK, now I sound like an infomercial). Last night my daughter was shaking up the bottle of balsamic vinaigrette and lo and behold, the cap was not all the way snapped down on the cruet. Yes, you guessed it. Salad dressing shower. And wouldn&#39;t you know it? She&#39;d just taken a shower, washed her hair and put on clean clothes. Sigh. But here&#39;s the great part! Dish soap once again comes to the rescue!! It got all the balsamic vinegar and oil out of her shirt with very little elbow grease on my part! I&#39;ve even gotten bike chain grease off of clothing with dish soap. This is a miracle cleaner if there ever was one!! </p><p>My cleaning work is now finished here. I think I&#39;ll take the rest of the year off. </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2009/08/whats-under-your-sink/">What's under your sink?</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I am fond of order, yet order often eludes me. My desk, which explodes paper on a daily basis,&#0160;is a good example. Ditto the dining room table (art supplies), the nightstand (books and magazines), the entry (shoes, backpacks, reusable bags), the laundry room&#0160;(too numerous to list)&#0160;--&#0160;essentially my entire house. The exceptions, weirdly enough, are the under-sink cabinets. Within these cabinets, order reigns. Witness the kitchen cabinet:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a53be40c970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a53be4c4970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a></p>
<p>I know exactly what&#39;s under there:&#0160;cleaning supplies, waste receptacles and our lone emergency roll of paper towels (banished to the dark recesses under the sink, wah ha ha ha). And that&#39;s it. Because we&#39;ve whittled down our cleaning supplies to the bare minimum, they don&#39;t take up much room. I wrote about <a href="../../../2008/08/what-are-your-f/">favorite eco-friendly cleaning products</a> about a year ago, and not much has changed on my end. Under the kitchen sink I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://biokleenhome.com/" target="_blank">Biokleen</a> powdered dishwasher detergent&#0160;and liquid dish soap</p>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ph12-6.com/" target="_blank">Ph12.6</a> for degreasing countertops and appliances</p>
<li>
<p>Vinegar for washing the floor&#0160;</p>
<li>
<p>Marmoleum floor sealer (only needed twice a year)</p>
<li>
<p>Compost bucket</p>
<li>
<p>Recycled content kitchen garbage bags (we empty our kitchen garbage once a week, so&#0160;one box lasts about 7 months)</p>
<li>
<p>Bucket and kitchen sponges</p></li>
</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>If my cabinet had looked like this when my kids were babies, I probably wouldn&#39;t have been terribly concerned about them getting into it and ingesting poisons. I would definitely still baby-proof the cabinet...these products do contain &#39;caution&#39; language, and of course I wouldn&#39;t want my babies playing with the plastic bags...but it&#39;s a much safer cabinet than when it contained Cascade, Windex, et al. Heck, it&#39;s safer for us grown-ups, too.</p>
<p>The bathroom is equally lean:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a53bf3ee970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a></p>
<p>We&#39;ve pared it down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.bonami.com/" target="_blank">Bon Ami</a> for cleaning the toilet</p>
<li>
<p>Biokleen for the tile, sink and tub</p>
<li>
<p>Vinegar and baking soda for clearing clogged drains (also good for cleaning toilets)</p>
<li>
<p><a href="../../../2007/09/easy-peasy/">Recycling bucket</a> (emptied twice a month)</p>
<li>
<p>Garbage can (emptied once a month)</p>
<li>
<p>Two sponges (one for toilet, one for everything else), old toothbrush for cleaning grout, rubber gloves</p>
<li>
<p>Caddy for carrying&#0160;supplies to the&#0160;kid&#39;s bathroom</p>
<li>
<p>Dr. Bronner&#39;s castile soap for...I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve never opened it. I felt I needed to own it, yet I&#39;ve never used it. Help me.</p></li>
</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>While I can&#39;t say (nor can my husband) that I&#39;m a dedicated housekeeper, I do feel good about the state of our under-sink cabinets. This is all of our cleaning&#0160;products (except for laundry-related) so when the cleaning muses call to me (and they&#39;ve been on an extended overseas vacation lately...take your time, ladies!) I&#0160;can get down to&#0160;business in an orderly, non-toxic&#0160;fashion. </p>
<p>Are you feeling good about your under-sink cabinets and your cleaning products?</p>

				<p>We&#39;re going camping this weekend with a great group of friends and surprisingly, I&#39;m not in a tizzy getting ready. I think it&#39;s thanks to the collective wisdom of the bunch, and that there will be a pack of kids who all know and like one another and <em>should</em> play nicely together, and the fact that we&#39;ll be bringing lots of beer on ice. We &#39;car camp&#39; about once per summer. Although last summer we flaked out at the last minute because it was the end of August, and by then we moms decided it was time for summer to be OVER and the work of planning and packing all the necessary gear sounded far too exhausting. I&#39;m making it sound like we don&#39;t like camping, when that&#39;s not the case at all. We love camping for it&#39;s way of <a href="../../../2007/08/outdoor-kids-i-/">releasing the outdoor kid in all of us</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201157209cadf970b-pi" style="float: right;"></a> This particular trip has been in the works for a few months. Trying to get five or more families to commit to the same weekend during summer turned out to be next to impossible. Although we did have five registered at one point, one recently had to bow out. THEN it was discovered that the camp site we picked was horribly infested with recently hatched <strong>ravenous</strong> mosquitoes. Like an x-file (remember that show?)! The moms scrambled. We swapped sites in the hopes we will have fewer encounters with blood sucking insects. Regardless, we plan to come well armed: lotions, potions, sprays, wrist bands, vitamin supplements, high-pitched buzzing devices, citronella candles, camp-fire, thick clothing layers, you name it! Anything to keep the dreaded itchy-scratchy at bay. One of our moms offered to bring a bunch of the more natural, less toxic potions for all of us to sample. Please imagine me looking around, lowering my voice and making sure no one is hearing an EnviroMom say this next part: <em>And some DEET-based option to use as a last resort</em>. We are locked and loaded. </p><p>How do you keep the skeeters at bay as non-toxically as possible? Any products you love or hate? Please share!</p><p>(photo by phillyburbs.com/courier times)</p>
