Yesterday&#39;s test came by way of a stopped up sink in the kid&#39;s bathroom. I&#39;ve lamented in the past that <a href="../../../2009/12/reducing-toothpaste-waste-and-reusing-dental-floss/">whole tubes of toothpaste have gone down this drain</a>. And hair and soap. Thus my day of reckoning arrived. Sigh.<br/><br/>I spent about two hours trying to snake and plunger the clog free yesterday. I ended up cross and disgusted by the primordial ooze that emanated from the sink. Inexplicably I also retrieved a vast amount of pine needles. Yet the dang-blasted clog would not break up. Ooooh how that devil on my shoulder kept whispering in my ear: &#39;drano…. liquid plumr foaming pipe snake….&#39; I googled all the natural enzymatic alternatives with nary a testament that promised that they really work. More along the lines of: use these to keep your drains running freely on a regular basis! Well, nuts to that. Google did of course bring up about 2 million instances of the vinegar and baking soda treatment which didn&#39;t appear worth my time given the beaver dam I seemed to be up against.<br/><br/>As a last ditch effort, I removed the drain trap and of course spilled murky water all over the bathroom floor and sadly, the clog was not there but beyond, deep in the pipes within the walls. Having arrived in DIY failure-ville, I called a plumber who brought his professional skills and snaked the clog out this morning. There really is nothing quite like a competent plumber to make you feel like everything is going to be alright. Or maybe that&#39;s just me. <br/><br/>Anyway, back to that &#39;ounce of prevention&#39; wisdom. He recommended some mesh strainers to keep the hair and gunk out first and foremost. Why oh why haven&#39;t I done this before? They are $2 apiece. I went on a shopping spree. I got one for every sink in the house! Oh, and he did say that antibacterial soaps are especially good at gumming up pipes, so that gives me yet another reason to remain steadfast against using them. <br/><br/>TGIF! Wishing everyone a lovely weekend with free-flowing drains and no sewer problems in sight!

And they are glorious! Can't you just feel the Vitamins D? It doesn't matter that's it's still dang cold out. That wee bit of sun is enough to get kids back outside playing, and fair-weather friends into their walking shoes and/or bike seats. Heck -- my dear husband got up on a ladder this past weekend and cleaned the gutters!<br><br>The sun has also prompted me to do something that might seem a tad bit crazy given that it's January. I've opened all the windows and doors. It helps if you work up a good head of steam by vigorously cleaning the house first. Let all that nasty indoor air out, and give your house a giant fresh cleansing breath. Namaste!<br><p>I'm far from expert on toxins and indoor air quality, but have learned that indoor air quality is often much worse that what's outside. This time of year, it's probably at it's worst, since we button our houses up tight to keep all the expensive heat inside. Granted, not everyone who reads this is having the sunbreaks like us right now. But keep your eyes to the sky. And give your house a nice airing out the first chance you can get. Let the sun shine in! Your family's lungs will thank you. </p>
<p>(Go figure, as I'm aiming the camera at my sunlit open door, the rechargeable batteries croak. By the time I recharge them, it's rainy and gray again. Sigh. So much for the picture, but hey, it makes me glad I aired out my house earlier!)</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				Since the kids went back to school in September, it seems like the list of projects I have to do hasn&#39;t gotten any smaller. I tell myself every year that I&#39;ll get so much done once I have more time, and then all that &#39;new time&#39; seems to magically disappear. Why is that? <br/><br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2012875b302d3970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Junk-closet" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e2012875b302d3970c " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2012875b302d3970c-320wi.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"/></a> One thing I did recently accomplish that I&#39;m quite proud about was organizing a messy closet in our guest room. Does everyone have a junk drawer? Well, this closet would best be described as a junk closet. As much as it embarrasses me, I&#39;m going to show you the before picture:<br/><br/>Yep. Sad, I know. In my defense, this is the only closet in my house that looks like this. All the others are fairly organized. But this closet somehow became the home of every gift bag we&#39;d ever received, every cardboard box, every undisplayed nick-nack, every to-be sewn remnant, every to-be-crafted craft project, every unhung picture or frame, every to-be-smoked hookah pipe (not really -- the hookah is part of the nick-nack department but now that I&#39;m well out of college, having a pipe isn&#39;t as cool as it once was) and lastly a very big collection of vintage hats. You know -- the kind ladies used to wear all the time. Don&#39;t ask me why I have a collection of hats. Back to the closet. I feared for my life when I opened the door. Finally, enough was enough. I set aside some time to organize. <br/><br/><p>Here comes the part I&#39;m really proud about -- because it involves another mini project on my endless to-do list. Over the summer, it became evident that the two particle-board file cabinets I had storing all of the important papers in my office were falling apart. The cheaply made file drawer supports were plastic, and its support pegs broke. I tried gluing them back together to no avail. Then I fumed over it for a while. How in the heck did I end up with <strong>two </strong>cheaply made file cabinets? Wouldn&#39;t it have been a better idea to
make a date with a shredder rather than keep stuffing the files so full
that the drawers got so heavy that the supports broke? My bad: poor shopping choices from long before I became an EnviroMom. So that
was the conundrum: what to do with two broken file cabinets. The way I
saw it they were not good enough to donate to anyone. Who&#39;d want a
broken file cabinet? With our<strong> </strong><a href="../../../join-enviromoms-one-can-a/">one garbage can a month</a>, it wasn&#39;t like I could throw them away. So I fumed some more and finally decided I&#39;d have to take them to the dump and pay extra to trash them. But that still made me mad and I didn&#39;t want to. Finally it dawned on me that I didn&#39;t have to use them as file cabinets any more. The only part that didn&#39;t work was the plastic file supports. The drawers and the cabinet structure were still strong and true. The answer became suddenly clear. I could stick these in my junk closet and create order out of chaos and complete two projects at the same time! </p> <br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2012875b30b04970c-pi" style="float: left;"></a> So that&#39;s what I did here. I used one of the file cabinets vertically (on the lower right), and one horizontally on a shelf, middle right). Then I sorted my junk into categories, and found the new spaces created by the cabinets made it easier to see what I do have and keep it all organized. Meanwhile, I&#39;ve shredded my way down to two file drawers full of important papers that now sit on the floor of my office (not pictured), and I&#39;ve been searching high and low for an old metal filing cabinet but have yet to find one. Once those old drawers are emptied, I&#39;ll use them to better organize another closet because they really do the job. All in all, I&#39;m quite please with the result of my closet organizing especially since it also managed to keep something surprisingly still useful out of the dump. So once again, the time that I was stewing (let&#39;s not call it procrastinating even if it seems like that) allowed a creative idea to develop that prevented waste and solved two problems at once. Hip, hip, hurray for creative reuse!!<br/><br/>And please. Someone. Anyone. Tell me you have a really messy junk closet to help me feel less embarrassed. Maybe you even have a broken down piece of particle-board furniture that&#39;s looking for a new life. Please share.

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				I was peacefully eating my breakfast and reading the morning paper while the kids were playing in the living room. Peace was interrupted by the crash of glass breaking. A standing lamp had hit the floor, and not one, but <strong>two</strong> CFL light bulbs shattered. I ordered the kids out of the living room and the first thing that went through my mind was: MERCURY! The next thing that went through my mind was: WHAT WOULD GOOGLE DO?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a66656b8970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Broken-cfl-bulbs" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a66656b8970b image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a66656b8970b-800wi.jpg" title="Broken-cfl-bulbs"/></a> <br/> But no, I did not go straight to google. I went straight to the dust pan and brush, and got a plastic bag to seal away all the broken glass and mercury that was surely swirling around the room and slowly beginning to kill us. Once I got it all cleaned up, then I did google it and thank goodness for <a href="http://www.thegreenestdollar.com/2009/06/how-to-dispose-of-a-broken-cfl-bulb/">green blogger moms</a>. The first link I clicked -- in my desperation to find out if I was doing what I should be -- started loading, then <em>made me watch an ad</em>!! Grrrr. So I clicked through to a green blogger site, and really had a chuckle at myself because I reacted about the same as she had and did almost everything wrong. <br/><br/>I did learn that I should turn off the heater (which I promptly did) and put the broken bulb outside, which I then also did. And wipe the floor with a wet paper towel, and then dispose of those with the bulb. Ditto. I also then opened the windows (and oh-MAN! it was cold to be doing that for 15 minutes) to air out the room. So I guess I didn&#39;t do it all wrong. Or maybe because I did it so quickly right after first doing it wrong, I scored bonus safety points? I learned that it might have been best to use some tape to pick up the glass bits, and then throw that away too. And a piece of cardboard instead of my regular dust pan. Oops. <br/><br/>I&#39;m still awaiting an email reply from our local hazardous waste collection folks to find out what to do with the bagged broken bulbs (for the time being, it&#39;ll just keep our jack-o-lanterns company on the front porch). Each municipality may tell you something slightly different, so if you ever break any CFLs, it&#39;s best to contact your local experts before making that last move to get the broken bulbs out of your home. But I post so that you may know ahead of time how to safely dispose of a broken CFL rather than after (like me). Oh, and perhaps be more adamant with the kids about why we don&#39;t play wildly in the living room.

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a62497f7970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Fruitflies002" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a62497f7970c image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a62497f7970c-800wi.jpg" title="Fruitflies002"/></a> <br/> Pardon me as I go into Cliff Clavin mode...but it&#39;s a little known fact that fruit flies, those pesky bugs that seem to spontaneously generate whenever fresh produce enters the house, have&#0160;roughly a&#0160;<a href="http://www.fi.edu/tfi/units/life/living/living.html" target="_blank">seven-day life cycle</a>. This means that when a piece of produce comes into your home, it could contain fruit fly eggs, which rapidly metamorphosize into an actual fly,&#0160;which then immediately lays more eggs before its swift,&#0160;untimely death a few days later. They are fast and furious breeders and have no time to nurture long lasting relationships with their children (sniff)! Fruit flies can enter your home on produce, or through a screen (yes, even very fine mesh) or cracks in your home. They have a <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-fruit-flies-and-where-do-they-come-from.htm" target="_blank">wicked sense of smell</a> and can detect the alcohol&#0160;in fruit from far off. Therefore, to prevent an infestation it&#39;s a good idea to try to knock &#39;em out when you first see one.</p>
<p>I&#39;d only ever tried the futile hand-clap method to get rid of fruit flies until I read about another one in the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/foodday/" target="_blank">Oregonian&#39;s FOODday</a> section (the print version, ahem).&#0160;And yes! It actually works.:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>Put a little cider vinegar in a small bowl or jar, along with a piece of fruit. (I used an apple core.)&#0160;Cover it tightly with a piece of plastic and poke a few small holes in the plastic with a toothpick.&#0160;The flies will be attracted to the smell and will&#0160;find their way in, but won&#39;t be able to get out. Some will drown. When you&#39;ve caught a few dump them outside (in your compost bin!) and do it again until you are fruit-fly free.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I wonder if I can get Norm to buy me a beer. Cheers!</p>

</p> One of the things that I find challenging about being an EnviroMom is that every new purchasing decision I make is just so danged hard. Over the very hot summer, quite a few of our window blinds simply pooped out. The slim line of adhesive that holds the little fabric cells together came unglued. While the blinds had come with the house, and I&#39;m not sure how old they were, it&#39;s the kind of thing that you don&#39;t appreciate how much you love and use them, until they don&#39;t work anymore. <br/><br/>So my first band-aid attempt to repair them used a few wooden clothespins to temporarily refasten the spots that came unglued. Well. Voila! That worked for about 10 seconds. They just tore in new spots. I guess when the glue decides to give on these things, it&#39;s O-V-E-R! <br/><p>OK. Plan B. I&#39;d swap some. Some windows really need to be covered for privacy or to block the sun. Others, not so much. So without moving any hardware, I prioritized and swapped the blinds. Well... That didn&#39;t work either. Because in about 10 minutes (note the improved performance of my solutions), these blinds broke too. Repeat conclusion about the glue just being finished. </p><p>I toyed with the idea of trying to reglue the blinds&#39; fabric cells. But quickly realized there wasn&#39;t a snowball&#39;s chance in you-know-where of that working or looking any better than my kids&#39; art projects. </p>Sigh. I haven&#39;t even gotten to the painful part yet. Ready for the pain? Now I have to figure out what to replace them with. Sure, I could go to 3-Day Blinds or some such place, and buy something similar to what I had. Heck, I could go to Ikea and get some cheap-o replacements that might last 10 days! But then, maybe these kinds of blinds aren&#39;t meant to last. And that drives me crazy. So maybe I should get wood blinds. Those pretty plantation shutters. But, what about the wood? Are they made from local wood and painted with no VOC paints? OK. Maybe blinds just aren&#39;t the answer. Drapes! I like fabric. Yes, drapes! But then, is the fabric organically grown and fair trade? And what about all the new hardware I&#39;d need. How was that metal mined? Urgh. Do you kill yourself like this too? That&#39;s why you&#39;ll find a sheet pinned over the most sun-blinding window over my desk. It&#39;s eco-analysis-paralysis. <br/><br/>If there&#39;s any silver-lined cloud in this story, it&#39;s that Heather taught me that I can actually <a href="../../../2009/07/what-to-do-with-old-mini-blinds/">recycle my broken blinds</a>, if I ever get around to deciding how to replace them. As for what to do in the long-term, I guess I&#39;m still mulling that over. Any advice on green window covering options would be most welcome.

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2009/07/what-to-do-with-old-mini-blinds/">What to do with old mini blinds?</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201157117212d970c-pi" style="FLOAT: right"></a> I will never, ever, ever again purchase mini blinds. Ever. Perhaps because I&#39;ve always gone with cheap-o aluminum, cut &#39;em while you wait blinds, I&#39;ve always ended up hating them after awhile. A couple of years ago I took down some metal blinds in our son&#39;s room, and they&#39;ve been sitting in our laundry room (aka the room where unused&#0160;household items&#0160;go to die) ever since. They must go! But where?</p>
<p>Most Goodwill-type places won&#39;t accept them. In fact, I don&#39;t know of any organization that will. I have, however, come up with&#0160;four tantalizing options:</p>
<p>1) List them for free on Craigslist or Freecycle. Someone, <em>someone</em> is certainly looking for blinds of this exact proportion. Certainly!</p>
<p>2) Dismantle them and put the metal parts in the curbside recycling bin. You can do this in Portland -- I checked with Metro. But <em>any</em> curbside program that accepts scrap metal should accept them. You just need to make sure you&#39;re only putting in metal pieces -- that there isn&#39;t any plastic attached or embedded somewhere -- and that you cut it down to size if needed. In Portland, scrap metal must be no larger than 30 inches in any direction.</p>
<p>3) Take them to the <a href="http://blindrecycler.com/Home_Page.html" target="_blank">Blind Recycler</a>. Yes, Portland&#0160;metro&#0160;peeps, we have a blind recycler up in Vancouver! (Sorry everyone else.) They will accept any kind of window covering except draperies for recycling. For FREE. So even vinyl mini blinds, or the miserable, broken&#0160;roller shade from IKEA that I bought to replace the miserable metal mini blinds. If you really want to be an enviro-star, ask your friends if they have any window coverings to recycle, collect&#0160;them all&#0160;and make one trip.</p>
<p>4) Keep them and get crafty! I found some interesting reuse ideas for mini blinds. You could <a href="http://littlegreennotebook.blogspot.com/2009/02/make-shades-out-of-mini-blinds.html" target="_blank">take your old mini blinds and turn them into shades</a>, which is pretty impressive. Or you could <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1666776/how_to_make_free_plant_labels_from.html?cat=24" target="_blank">turn your vinyl mini blinds into plant labels</a>. Finally, you might enjoy cutting <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/hg/index.ssf/2008/12/maxing_the_minis_new_ideas_for.html" target="_blank">up your vinyl blinds into gift tags and ribbons, or weaving them into coasters</a>! Or not.</p>
<p>The thing with vinyl mini blinds -- you have to be careful about lead. Back in 1996 the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML96/96150.html" target="_blank">CPSC discovered lead in&#0160;vinyl blinds imported from Mexico and Asia</a>. The plastic would break down, causing lead dust to form making it a serious health hazard for tots. If you think your blinds qualify,&#0160;throw them out.</p>
<p>Any other recycling or reuse ideas for mini blinds to share?</p>

				<p>It&#39;s done! Woo hoo! I&#39;ve spent years dreaming of what our kitchen could be one day. All of those HGTV redesign shows and home decor magazines fueled a serious case of kitchen envy that had me sketching and measuring and wondering if we&#39;d ever be able to afford our dream kitchen makeover. And then the dream shifted (along with the economy). It became less about the sleek cabinets and the hi-tech appliances and the giant island/gathering place and the maybe-we-can-bump-out-a-wall scenarios and more about how to get the biggest bang for our dwindling bucks while keeping it eco-friendly. It was about appreciating what we had and figuring out what would really make us happy. Big impact with little planetary and bank account impact. We called it the Recession Remodel.</p>
<p>Our kitchen started out like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201157203a83d970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a> </p>
<p>Dark and cramped, with a horrible vinyl floor that never seemed to look clean after a washing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201157203a86f970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a> </p>

So that&#39;s why I bought this box of wine, that I would not otherwise have gotten. I scanned the box at the store, and read the many green marketing claims. It said far more about the enviro friendly aspects of the packaging than the wine, which can be risky, but thankfully, my mom is not a connoisseur. It is pretty amazing that this small box contains the same volume as three regular bottles of wine. </p><p>But back to visitors. I don&#39;t know about you. Things have changed a lot in the past few years in our house. My mom is our most regular visitor, and luckily, she&#39;s pretty adaptable to all our green quirks. I try not to impose our enviro-freakish ways on guests as a general rule, but with the kids, it&#39;s sometimes hard to take a pass. The kids are quick to tactlessly point out if someone is wasting water while they are brushing their teeth. I appreciated that my mom asked if there was any laundry we needed done before starting a load with her travel clothes, thus ensuring a full load. But then I bit my tongue when she threw the wash in the dryer on a flawlessly sunny day. </p><p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e201156fa9e5af970c-pi" style="float: right;"></a> Put on your thinking caps readers, if you will. My daughters&#39; jewelry boxes runneth over. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong. They are not dripping in diamonds and pearls. But they do tend to acquire a fair number of Mardi Gras beads and hand-strung macaroni necklaces and costume jewelry from rummage sales, birthdays and grandmas, and the occasional bit of semi-&#39;good&#39; stuff. My 7-year-old got her ears pierced for her last birthday, so we are adding sets of posts with time to her collection. Thus, the teeny, tiny jewelry boxes with the ballerinas spinning are filling up. I try to reason with them. That perhaps, just maybe, we could hand on some of the necklaces... Perhaps, we should save room for the better stuff? And they look at me as if I have grown a third eye. Because to them, in their youth and sweetness, anything that glitters is gold. </p><p>My 7-year old suggested we put a whole bunch of push pins in the wall, and just hang the necklaces and bracelets that way, so that they don&#39;t get tangled any more. High marks for practicality. But I would like to minimize the number of holes in the wall. And perhaps something just a little prettier? This is about girls and jewelry, after all. I&#39;m thinking this would be a perfect reuse project. Bottle caps? Buttons? Pieces of scrap wood and ribbon and wire? Of course, my first impulse was to run to Michaels and buy something new. But then I remembered the importance of Reduce-Reuse, and stopped myself. I realize this is just a trifle. The fate of the planet does not hang on this. But baby steps, right? Training our kids not to go out and buy something new?</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas? Seen anything good like this elsewhere in the blogosphere for organizing necklaces and bracelets? I wish I had some great give-away offer to make, but alas, not today. My undying gratitude? A large collection of plastic bags? </p>
