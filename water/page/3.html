					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2007/07/do-under-the-si/">Do under the sink garbage disposals get the green thumbs up or down?</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Hope is wondering how green under-sink garbage disposals are:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Ok, so I'm going to the experts here, what's the word on under-sink garbage disposals?&nbsp; Other than diapers, a lot of our garbage seems to be table scraps that can't be composted.&nbsp; We're thinking of remodelling our kitchen next year and I was wondering if it would be good to include a garbage disposal into the plan.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; Thanks!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You are too kind to call us experts, Hope. But here's my understanding of the situation with a little help from the <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recyclers</a> and Portland Environmental Services' &quot;After the Flush&quot; publication. According to Lauren, the master recycler coordinator, &quot;The majority of the roughage, or
more fiberous material (if you will) is filtered immediately at the
treatment plant and sent to the landfill.&nbsp; The majority of this is
paper, but some of the food from the disposal will also be filtered
here. So it is the same problem: it ends up at the landfill. However,
this first screen is fairly wide and I would say some of the food
(especially if you have an efficient disposal) will get through this
filter. It will then be put through several levels of physical or
biological filters that end up then being used as compost in Eastern
Oregon.&nbsp; So, it is better than just throwing it away as it has a chance
of being composted via the sewer system.&quot; Additionally, Lauren adds &quot;I get the impression that Portland is unique
in composting our waste from sewers. I would bet that most
jurisdictions are landfilling.&quot;</p>
<p>I've posted about <a href="../../../2007/03/after_the_flush/">how informative the &quot;After the Flush&quot; brochure is</a>, especially to kids who enjoy anything with a high grossness factor. For all intents and purposes, any wastewater or solids in the sewers, whether from flushing toilets or kitchen drains/disposals all goes through the same process. So does the garbage disposal get the thumbs up or down? Kinda depends on where you live. I'd suggest you compost as much as you can at home as a first step because then you know with certainty what is happening to it.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/OSD/index.cfm?c=edafc">Portland Metro will very likely expand the recycling options of home-owners in the next two years</a>. Hopefully we'll soon be putting kitchen scraps out for composting in curbside bins as they currently do in Seattle and San Francisco. It does remain to be seen what scraps will be included.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My mom, who lives in Hawaii, is called &quot;Tutu&quot; by my kids (which means &quot;Grandma&quot; in Hawaiian). She just flew back to her island paradise this morning after a wonderful stay with us. As you probably know from reading EnviroMom, much of this green living stuff is new to Heather and I. So a lot of our new &quot;funny ways&quot; -- such as <a href="../../../2007/06/cheap-o-dad-fun/">greywater reuse</a>, getting our <a href="../../../2007/06/communitysuppor/">produce through a CSA</a>, and our REI method (<strong>R</strong>ecycle <strong>E</strong>very <strong>I</strong>tem) due to our <a href="../../../2007/03/victory_downsiz/">minimalist garbage service</a> pickup -- were new to my mom. I have to applaud her. She was a trooper. Last night as we were boiling pasta for dinner she asked if I wanted to use the boiled water for killing weeds on the patio. She just got with the program. Very cool. Not going to make the comparison to old dogs learning new tricks. </p>
<p>One of the really cool things my mom did on this visit was arrive with a suitcase full of goodies for the girls. Swimsuits, books, puzzles, dresses. Does this scenario sound familiar when the grands come to your house too? What really rocked was that she got all their goodies from garage sales. I love that it was all second-hand/reused goods. It was still all new to my kids. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Fellow Master Recycler Russell H. sent us a link on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11797409">New York City's spendy campaign to get New Yorkers to drink tap water</a>. Handing out free water bottles to convince people that the potable water that comes very inexpensively into their homes is worth a sip.</p>
<p>It's amazing what marketing does to us. Slap a label like Evian or Poland Springs onto a water-filled plastic bottle, call it mineral water and voila, it's a cash cow.</p>
<p>I don't claim any special intellectual powers, but somehow I never fell under the spell of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_water">bottled water</a>. Since I do the majority of the grocery shopping, adding a heavy case of water to every shopping trip never seemed like a good idea to me. </p>
<p>When we first moved to Portland I remember thinking that this was the tastiest tap water in the world. I still think that. Sometimes I've even got my act together enough to drink 8 glasses of water a day.</p>
<p>What about you? Do you drink from the tap? Do you think bottled is better? Do you go for tap with a little Brita filtering action on the side? Do you think tap gets a bad rap?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Betty from our <a href="../../../greengroups/index/">GreenGroup</a> has an interesting approach to laundry. She doesn't sort it by color, and she washes everything in cold water. I think she said she got the idea from <a href="http://www.flylady.net/">flylady</a>. The pros of this scenario are several:</p>
<ul><li>Save energy by not heating the water</li>
<li>Save energy by always washing full loads</li>
<li>Save some time by not having to sort</li></ul>
<p>Betty claims she's seen no difference in the wash quality. Yet, I can't bring myself to try this; the idea kind of scares me. I've been washing clothing the way my mom taught me for years (i.e., sorting into white, light and dark piles. Hot for whites, warm for lights, cold for darks). </p>
<p>What do you think? How do you wash? Stuck in the old way like me? Or ready to save some energy and try something new?</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2007/06/cheap-o-dad-fun/">Cheap-o-Dad: fun with greywater</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Cheap-o-Dad has quickly gotten behind this green thing, once he realized you could be cheap and green at the same time. </p>
<p>One of his pet projects is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greywater">greywater</a> reuse. The first thing we did was put a big bucket outside the main exterior hose faucet. We have changed hoses, changed the gaskets, tried magic chants, and nothing will stop that hose connection from dripping when it is on. So now we make sure all the drip water is caught in a bucket, and we use it primarily to water the exterior plants.</p>
<p>The second one was to get a bucket for the shower. We use it to capture all the cold water that runs out (before it turns hot enough to take the shower). If we had any houseplants we'd water those, but that not being the case (I composted them when my kids hit the toddler stage -- too many were poisonous and I would flip out when they'd start playing with the dirt in the pots, making mud pies <em>inside</em> the house). So Cheap-o-Dad mostly uses this water for cold water torture in the bathtub. While the tub is filling, the kids usually hop in and then Cheap-o-Dad squirts cold greywater from the shower bucket on them via squirt-guns or dumps it on them from little re-used yogurt buckets. You'd think they'd hate this. But they squeal and laugh and seem to love this weird form of bathtub torture my husband has concocted for them. </p>
<p>Recently, Cheap-o-Dad has taken to cutting the top off a plastic milk jug to enlarge the opening, and keeps it under the tap in the kitchen sink. This captures any greywater from hand-washing of dishes. We then use this water to pre-rinse before putting dishes in the dishwasher or also for watering exterior plants.</p>
<p>While we haven't gotten around to disconnecting our downspouts and capturing rainwater, we seem to have really made a dent in conserving indoor water use (our water bill shows a major decrease in monthly water usage). Do you reuse your greywater, and if so, what are your favorite tricks?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My friend Amy recently went to a presentation about <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/bes/index.cfm?c=43444&amp;">Clean River Rewards</a>. I'd been under the false impression that the rewards only went to certain areas on the eastside of town. I'm sharing what we discussed, in the hopes it'll motivate more of us to sign up for Clean River Rewards:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The rebates are citywide. Commissioner Sam Adams had a special session at the Multnomah Arts Center in which he said our part of town has special challenges in containing runoff because of our hilly terrain, and for that reason the city is going to be a little more generous in allowing rebates in SW.</p>
<p>It doesn't take much to meet the criteria for a rebate, especially for newer construction like ours. For example, we have a French drain, which we didn't even put in -- the builders did because our lot slopes from north to south -- and that counts as an anti-runoff action. Another one is disconnecting downspouts, which I didn't understand at first, but it turns out to be just having your gutter downspout disperse rainwater into your lawn rather than into the sewer system. I have to go outside and check, but I'm pretty sure our downspouts came that way. </p>
<p>If I recall correctly, even planting large trees can count. Adams had a PowerPoint that showed some pretty ingenious DIY methods of containing runoff, including digging a subtle depression into your lawn.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Are you signed up for Clean River Rewards? What changes did you make to qualify?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A comment by Becky the other day about <a href="../../../2007/05/rates_are_risin/">conserving electricity</a> got me thinking that my hot water heater was in need of a blanky. I took a trip to the hardware store, and bought a blanket. They're cheap -- less than 20 bucks. And it's one-size-fits-all. I had checked to see how big my tank was before I went, but it turns out I should have done a little <a href="http://www.stretcher.com/stories/970127c.cfm">internet research</a>, and read the water heater manual first.</p>
<p>The rules of thumb for blanketing your water heaters:</p>
<ul><li>If your water heater is more than 10 years old, you will likely save energy by blanketing it</li>
<li>If your water heater feels warm to the touch, you will likely save energy by blanketing it</li></ul>
<p>Ours is less than 10 years old. We'd even bought a very energy-efficient model when the old one died a few years back. But what I did find is that our hot water heater has a few energy savings settings that I was not utilizing:</p>
<ul><li>I dropped the temp a bit from 120 to 115 degrees. With the current summery weather, I didn't think we'll notice that difference.</li>
<li>I switched from Smart, to Energy Smart in the setting. Hopefully that will help a bit. There are also a few other modes for if we go on vacation, that I've never used but I vow to in the future.</li></ul>
<p>The other point Becky made was to insulate exposed hot water pipes coming from the heater. So I am going to return the blanket, and exchange it for some pipe insulation. TTFN! Off to the hardware store!!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm as excited as the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/editorials/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/118048471435780.xml&amp;coll=7">Oregonian to be toasting the new, improved bottle bill</a> (which includes non-fizzy bottled water for the first time). The only thing I'd suggest is we toast with our <a href="http://www.thegreenguide.com/doc/101/plastic">durable water bottles</a>, instead of the disposable plastic ones that many Americans consume like they were bottled at the fountain of youth. Recycling is great. If the new bottle bill incents people to recycle plastic bottles via their pocketbook, more power to 'em. But I think we need to encourage them to <a href="../../../2007/05/best_way_to_red/">buy less stuff</a>, as Heather posted a while back. Portland is home to some of the best drinking water is the world. If you don't have one already, get yourself a durable water bottle, and stop buying those big ol' cases of water from the grocery store. Lord knows where that water comes from. But I'll bet you a dollar it wasn't the fountain of youth. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We often compare our <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/">blogs</a> to a virtual playground, as we build community and learn so many things chatting with other parents while our kids play at the playground. Here's a great idea my friend Elaine shared with me (at a playground) last week. Take the water you'd normally pour down the drain after boiling pasta, and pour it on a weed or two instead. The heat of the scalding water will take that weed out faster than a spritz of Roundup (and happily, it's a little less toxic than the chemical approach). Listen up all you weeds growing between the cracks in my patio -- your days are numbered!! We boil a lot of pasta around here...</p>
