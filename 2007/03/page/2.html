					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../../2007/03/shades_of_green/">Shades of green and the chicken of doom</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I find myself surrounded by <a href="http://knittinmom.blogspot.com/2007/03/oh-ducks.html">online</a> and <a href="../../../../2007/03/greengroup_325_/">offline</a> discussions about chickens lately. That's a little terrifying for me, and I'd like to explain.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, growing up in the Chicago suburbs, my folks liked to send me and my brother to visit <a href="http://www.columbus.in.us/listings/index.cfm?action=displayListing&amp;listingID=4601&amp;catID=347&amp;subCatID=3108&amp;startrange=All&amp;endrange=All&amp;substart=M&amp;subend=S&amp;notify=1&amp;ShowTab=0">relatives who owned a farm and produce market in Columbus, Indiana</a>. Ostensibly, it was to let us chew on a little hay and learn about the circle of pastoral life. In reality, I think they were just happy to be rid of us for a few weeks each summer while Uncle Bill and Aunt Shirley filled us up with as much corn on the cob, ribs and black-eyed peas as humanly possible. Except for the effect the grub had on my LDLs, that's not the terrifying part yet. </p>
<p>One day I was hanging out with some of the local teenagers who worked at the produce stand. They were teasing an old rooster named Mort who was strutting around. I had no experience with chickens, but didn't feel it was right to tease him. I tried to get them to stop. I must have been about 7 years old. They didn't stop, and Mort got mad. Ironically, he chose to vent his frustrations on me (probably because I was the smallest).&nbsp; He started pecking after me, and I ran like the devil was on my tail. That rooster chased me around the farmhouse, and Aunt Shirley intervened by the time I'd looped the house once and ran screaming up to the front door. Aunt Shirley was not to be messed with. She told Mort to leave me alone, but not before he pecked on my knees and bloodied me up a bit. Needless to say, I was scarred both physically and mentally by the experience, young suburban girl that I was. It wasn't until I got to university that I learned the word &quot;mort&quot; means &quot;death&quot; in Latin. </p>
<p>So the whole idea of chickens is just beyond me. And apologies for this rambling post, but my point is it's ok if it's beyond you too. If you feel like switching to waxed baggies from plastic is about all you can handle right now, then more power to you -- that's OK! We are all at different stages -- various shades of green -- and all of them are good. Remember to take baby steps. Do what you can, and don't get overwhelmed by things that just don't seem feasible to you. Even though Heather, others in my GreenGroup and lots of new online friends may be harvesting their own eggs soon, let me tell ya', I don't think I'll be getting chickens anytime ever! </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Today was our GreenGroup's first &quot;home visit,&quot; and three of us (me, Renee and Jen) we went to Erin's house. Erin and her husband, Andrew, have been renovating their house for five years, and I gotta say, it's the closest I've ever been to a <a href="http://www.dwell.com/">Dwell</a> magazine-worthy house. Interesting use of materials, great lighting, and a kitchen to die for (concrete counter tops, glass tile, dark wood cabinets, stainless apps - gorgeous). They are trying to incorporate as much green-building into the house as they can, and an eco-roof on the shed may be blooming in the near future. Erin's been saving her food scraps all week, so Renee showed her how to do <a href="../../../../2007/03/i_did_it_my_way/">in-ground composting</a>. Jen brought a bucket of worms from her compost pile to add to the slop. A few other nuggets we discovered:</p>
<ul><li>Erin and Andrew have a huge lot, so they planted an <a href="http://protimelawnseed.com/fleur_de_lawn.htm">eco-lawn</a>, which is a mix of grass, flowers and ground cover. It requires no watering or fertilizer, and you only need to mow it once a year. It only grows to about 6 inches long, though because of its length it's not the easiest lawn for a small child to play in. I meant to ask her whether it attracts bees, which would be a deterrent for my kids. </li>
<li>Erin has white washcloths stacked in her kitchen, a substitute for paper towels and napkins (I love this idea). She buys them in jumbo packs. (Maybe she'll tell us where?) </li>
<li>As we were leaving, Erin packed us some baked goods in <a href="http://www.pristineplanet.com/details.asp?id=2124">waxed paper baggies</a> (you can find them at New Seasons and other natural food stores), which she uses instead of plastic zip-locks. She believes you can compost these baggies, much like <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/util/Services/Yard/Yard_Waste_Collection/AcceptableYardFoodWaste/index.htm">Seattle is now composting its pizza boxes</a>. And when she does get a plastic bag, she washes it and reuses it until it's falling apart!</li></ul>
<p>Thanks for a great afternoon, Erin!</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Not too long ago, I remember feeling like there were so many things I <em>should be doing</em> for the environment -- but I wasn't. I just didn't feel like I had the bandwidth. I don't have time to watch TV. How was I going to find the time to recycle beyond curbside, take field trips to the recycle centers, go native in my garden, home brew non-toxic cleaners, educate my kids about why I was doing all these new-fangled projects, start the <a href="/">EnviroMom blog</a> with Heather, etc. and so forth. I was exhausted just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Flash forward to now. I can't believe how <em>good</em> it feels. It's like getting into a new, challenging workout routine. After you get past the achy muscle stage, it really feels good. What I'm doing feels right and rewarding. Do you know what I mean? Does going green feel that way to you too?</p>

				<p>Does anyone know if photo paper is recyclable? I've been working on scrapbooks this morning, and I've trimmed some of the pictures and have passed on some really bad shots. I've never thought to put photo paper in the mixed recycling before, but thought I'd ask to see if any of you know...</p>
<p>Also -- while I'm asking -- is that fax-type receipt paper recyclable? That's another paper I usually just put in the garbage, but thought I would check to see if anyone knows if it can be included with mixed paper, or recycled elsewhere. </p>
<p>Does anyone know if either of these types of paper are recyclable? Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../../2007/03/multnomah_washi/">Multnomah & Washington counties will now accept more types of curbside plastics!</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>(April 2007) Just an update from our Master Recyclers class: Plastic tubs and lids are accepted now curbside in Beaverton and Clackamas counties. This should roll out in the rest of the Metro area in the next few months. Until then, let's keep our plastic tubs to ourselves (i.e., not set them out curbside until the haulers are ready).</p>
<p><a href="mailto:feisty_squirt@yahoo.com">Sheena</a> posted this comment already, but I felt it was worth calling out:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>I work for Waste Management and now in all of Washington county and Multnomah they are now excepting all yogart, margarine and those cottage cheese container as recycle. The cities haven't actually put out noticies to the residence as of now I believe but soon. I figured you would love to hear that.</p>
<p>Please be aware that the plastics processors in the Metro Region have agreed to start taking additional plastic as recycling. <br/><br/>Although not all of our municipalities have started advertising this to their residents, effective immediately, we will accept virtually all clean plastics for recycling, with the following exceptions:<br/>· Plastic bags <br/>· Styrofoam, polystyrene (foam) <br/>· Brittle plastics, clam shells bakery and deli containers<br/>In Clackamas county and Beaverton these plastics have been added to these municipalities' lists of recyclable plastics, and we expect other municipalities to add them to their lists in the near future.<br/><br/>But, even before they are officially added to the lists, we will now accept these materials curbside in areas collected by Washington County or Portland Hauling. This, of course includes dairy tubs, which have long been something our customers have wanted to recycle.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">This is great news, and long overdue. Thanks, Sheena! You can still recycle plastic bags at most grocery stores, and I know that <a href="http://www.farwestfibers.com/">Far West Fibers</a> will take rigid plastic containers. And, don't forget about the Master Recycler Roundup on May 19!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Well, as you can imagine, we've been dodging the paparazzi all day long, what with <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1174533922257500.xml&amp;coll=7&amp;thispage=1">today's front page Oregonian coverage of my children and me doing our composting thing</a> (ha, ha). But, we've gotten quite few emails as well, asking for me to elaborate on how we compost fruit and vegetable scraps. So, I'm glad to oblige.</p>
<p>We collect our fruit and vegetable scraps, egg shells, coffee grounds, etc. in a little crock in the kitchen.&nbsp; About once a week, we dig a hole in the yard about 12-18&quot; deep. We toss in all the scraps, then break it up into smaller pieces with the tip of the shovel (the smaller the bits, the quicker it will break down). Then we pile all the dirt we dug up back in the hole, stomp it down, and lay some paver bricks over the top to keep the raccoons from digging it back up. </p>
<p>I've read about worm bins, but that sounds like too much trouble if you ask me. This is easy, the worms, bacteria and bugs come and do the work for you. There's never been a problem with flies, bad smells or anything other than the raccoons, which we solved by laying bricks over the most recent dig. The raccoons seem to love the egg shells. </p>
<p>I can't really say how long it takes for it to break down entirely. We do not dig it back up and turn it, or revisit in any way. We gradually move our dig spots around the yard, which fertilizes and breaks up the clayey soil.</p>
<p>I give credit to my husband and his family for teaching us this composting method. They were born in the Philippines, and I've really come to admire the myriad ways they reduce, reuse and recycle in their daily lives. My friend Jen recently told me her family in rural Indiana composts in this way too. So it's nothing new, just us rediscovering a more traditional way of worm composting.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There are so many plastics that can be recycled beyond the ones you set curbside. On May 19, the volunteer corps of Master Recyclers will hold a <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/plastic-recycling.php">Plastics Roundup</a> in NE, NW and SW Portland. Stuff that is part of your daily life like plastic plant pots and trays, cereal box liners, dry cleaning bags and rigid plastic food take-out cartons can be recycled. Pet carriers (which Goodwill won't take), plastic lawn furniture and broken-down laundry baskets are some of the other items that can avoid the landfill. Check out <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/plastic-recycling/sort-of-plastics.php">the list</a> and try to start setting these items aside.</p>
<p>And just who the heck are the Master Recyclers? The City of Portland administers an 8-week course, with classes one night a week, where you learn everything you ever wanted to know about recycling and composting. Then you take your knowledge out into the community and get to put the title Master Recycler on your resume. Renee and I are starting the course in April, so stay tuned.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../../2007/03/victory_downsiz/">Victory: downsizing our garbage can</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In this rampant era of super-sized everything (have you noticed lately you can buy a chocolate bunny as big as a preschooler?), our family enters a new era by downsizing our trash can and depositing less landfill waste. </p>
<p>We'd been using a 20-gallon garbage can for years, and filling it pretty much to the brim each week due to having kids in disposable diapers for the past 5 years. But the <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/02/potty_training_.html">little one is now down to one nighttime diaper a day</a>, and our garbage can has become so light I can lift it with one hand. </p>
<p>So I called the <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/osd/index.cfm?a=bbaijf&amp;c=edaej">Troudt Brothers</a> (our sanitary and recycling carriers here in Hillsdale), and asked if we could switch to a smaller size or less frequent pickups. And we can! We now will put out our trash can the first week of every month on our regular pickup day. We still get to put out recycle bins weekly, and the yard waste bins (bi-weekly, according to the schedule). I never thought such a thing would make me so happy! Funny what gives you a thrill as you get older.</p>
<p>In addition to getting rid of the diapers, here are the things we do to keep our trash to a minimum:</p>
<ul><li>Compost food scraps (veggie and fruit peelings, coffee grounds, egg shells, etc.)</li>
<li>Compost yard waste</li>
<li>Recycle all the curbside pickup stuff (plastic bottles, glass, metal cans, foil, newsprint and mixed paper, cardboard, etc.)</li>
<li>Recycle non-curbside pickup items (all the rigid plastics, plastic bags, yogurt cups, etc.)</li></ul>
<p>I don't want to sound like I'm bragging. I never even realized this was an option until <a href="../../../../2007/03/greengroup_kick/">Jen from our GreenGroup mentioned she had monthly pickup</a>. Just food for thought. It's amazing how little garbage you can produce if you set your mind to it and change some habits. And it costs less each month, too.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Renee already posted about our <a href="../../../../2007/03/greengroup_kick/">first GreenGroup meeting</a>, which was really inspiring and eye-opening. We learned so much and have much to learn. The idea is this: you bring together a group of moms (or dads, too), say 4 - 8 tops, and you meet as often as the group is able. Our group decided to meet one Tuesday morning a month at the SW Community Center (so our kids could go to Kid Central while we talk) and one Sunday afternoon a month at one of our homes to show off things we've done and brainstorm ways to tackle new projects. We all live in SW Portland, so the commute is short. Renee and I put our group together by asking a couple of friends and talking to an acquaintance who brought along a friend. We all have different &quot;experience&quot; levels, but we all share the energy and motivation to make changes.</p>
<p>If you want to start or join a GreenGroup, send us an <a href="mailto:enviromompdx@gmail.com">email</a> and tell us what part of town you live in. We'll post it, and then interested moms will contact you directly. If you need advice or help preparing for your first meeting, or figuring out how to create actionable plans, we're here to help. What's important is that you start talking. Talking leads to doing, and once you hear about what other moms are doing, it will inspire you to start doing it, too. And one of these days we'll create a dedicated page for GreenGroups -- a place to create them and share what you're learning! </p>
