I thought, &quot;Camping in November? With little kids? Are you crazy, woman?&quot; But she's not. (Actually, I just met Hope at last week's <a href="../../../enviromom/greengroup-happenings/">Eastside GreenGroup meeting</a>, and she's quite sane...and delightful.) Here's her report (and my comments):</p>
<ul><li>First of all, it is great to go off-season because there are no crowds and the rates are cheaper. We have a small camper/trailer that we bought last year and it has been a wonderful investment. Our campsite backed up basically to a tree line that separated the beach and campground. You could actually see and hear the ocean from our campsite. (OK, so far so good. Really good.) </li>
<li>My husband took the kids to fly kites and build sandcastles while I got a much needed break. (I'd like my husband and kids to go fly a kite some days.) </li>
<li>We also visited <a href="http://www.funbeach.com/attractions/leadbetter.html">Leadbetter Point</a> and did some hiking.&nbsp; There are are a variety of mushrooms there,&nbsp; though not for picking. So that was fun to point out to the kids. (Mushrooms are cool. Wish I knew more about them.) </li>
<li>And we followed deer tracks through the sand. (Nice.) </li>
<li>Our next stop was the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/lewisclark/lcic/">Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center</a>. Very cool place. Lots of hands-on things for the kids to do. On the trail that leads up to the Interpretive Center, they have signs that tell what some of the trees are and it talks about the temperate forest. Our 4 yr old knew what a temperate forest was from the <a href="http://www.childrenssoftwareonline.com/Default.aspx?m=item&amp;source=froogle&amp;pID=1421">JumpStart Animal Adventures CD-ROM</a> we just got from the library. He even sang us a song. While we were there, I kept seeing this animal surface the water and dive back down. I never saw the head, but I definitely saw a dorsal fin. Of course while we were there, my husband never saw it and teased me that maybe I was seeing the Loch Ness Monster. And of course you can see <a href="http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=115">Cape Disappointment Lighthouse</a> from there. (Hmm, her 4-year old is smarter than me. I feel inadequate.)</li></ul>

			<div class="entry-more">
				<ul><li>The next day while we were waiting for my husband to get ready, the kids and I were sitting at the picnic table and two deer came through the edge of our campsite. (Cue the wildlife, please.)</li>
<li>Then we headed to <a href="http://www.funbeach.com/">Long Beach</a> where we walked boardwalk and saw the skeleton of a gray whale. Then headed over to the <a href="http://www.worldkitemuseum.com/">World Kite Museum</a> where the kids got to make their own kites, which was fun. (That skeleton sounds cool. Was it huge?)&nbsp; </li>
<li>We headed to the <a href="http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=116">North Head Lighthouse</a>, got the binoculars out and had fun watching the kids take turns looking at each other with the binoculars. I can't wait until the kids get old enough to tour the lighthouses -- they have to be 7 yrs old.&nbsp; </li>
<li>But the most amazing wildlife we saw were on our way home. We stopped and walked along the jetty before heading home.&nbsp; While there, &quot;Nessie&quot; made her appearance known to my husband. Then we saw a sea lion. And we were watching a seagull struggling with its lunch on the beach and all of a sudden a bald eagle swooped down and stole the seagull's lunch and took off, with the seagull in hot pursuit. It was all very amazing.&nbsp; Oh, and along one of the roads, we saw a great blue heron. </li>
<li>When we got home, we did a little research and &quot;Nessie&quot; was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_Porpoise">harbor porpoise</a>.&nbsp; </li>
<li>As for tips for camping/hiking with kids, if you have a reluctant hiker, keep treats/snacks in the car and tell them they have to walk all the way back to the car to get a treat.&nbsp; Our 4 yr old would hike all day long, but our 2 year old needs a little incentive. And have lots of hot chocolate on hand for warming the kids up after hiking or playing in the sand.</li></ul>
<p>Thanks, Hope, for sharing your family adventure with us. If we had a camper, I think I could do this. Tent camping in November...not so much. Even staying at a hotel on the coast, we could still enjoy the natural beauty and activities the coast offers. Cape Disappointment has been added to the list. Have you camped off-season with your kids? Tent or camper? Any good stories or locations to share?&nbsp; </p>
