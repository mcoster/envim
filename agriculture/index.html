		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last year, Heather and I decided to subscribe to the <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a> Community Supported Agriculture program without a lot of forethought. At the time when we signed up last spring, we were fairly new on our green journey, excitedly trying new things. Joining a CSA seemed like the right thing to do. We'd split a full box and pick it up weekly at the Hillsdale Farmers' Market. What we found was that being in the CSA had its <a href="../../2007/11/first-time-csa-/">highs and lows</a>. So there was <em>much discussion</em> this year on whether we would do it again. Gathering Together Farm lets last year's subscribers enroll before opening it to the general public. Although we went down the wire on our decision, ultimately we decided to go for it. There's no question that the CSA produce we ate last summer was the tastiest, healthiest we had ever had. There was a lovely feeling of community in meeting each weekend at our local farmer's market, running into old friends, meeting new ones. But there was also the frustration of having onions, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and squash coming out of our ears at times. We felt like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wp3m1vg06Q">Lucy and Ethel trying to keep up with the chocolates in that famous assembly line episode</a>. </p>
<p>But I do think we learned some important lessons. The most valuable: prep and freeze in small batches for the winter. Michelle told us that she'd take her box home every Sunday (our designated pickup day) and chop, prep and freeze everything she didn't think her family would eat that week. What a revelation. I had got myself all hyped to do big canning jobs, but when it came down to it, really didn't have the time or energy to do that. When I tried Michelle's approach and chopped and froze small portions of produce, it worked. I can't tell you how happy I've been to pop a chopped pepper out of the freezer and throw it into a curry I'm making for dinner. </p>
<p>The other thing we learned is that we have to be ready. We had grand visions of preserving fresh berries by dehydration. But come berry season -- which really sneaks up on you -- we didn't have a dehydrator. We hadn't researched one. Which one was the best? Gosh, did we really want to add another appliance to our appliance-filled kitchens? Would we really use it? How would we store our dehydrated produce once we'd dried it? A case of analysis paralysis. Flash back to the scene of Lucy and Ethel. My family was buying and eating fresh berries as fast as our local farmers could grow them. Then it was melons. And the squash and tomatoes and pepper piles were piling up. So, it just never happened. </p>
<p>This year will be different. I'm researching that dehydrator now. So I'm excited about our next CSA season. And happy to know that we've inspired lots of friends to take that plunge, and join a CSA of their own. Are you new to joys of CSA? What are some of the valuable lessons you've learned, that you'd like to share?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We're all for locally farmed foods getting into Oregon schools. How about you? Here's the deal on what's being considered by the Oregon legislature on January 23:</p><blockquote><p>Locally grown foods will become more prevalent in school cafeterias by the end of this year under a new farm-to-school and school garden concept now under consideration in the Oregon Legislature. Introduced by the Oregon Farm-to-School and School Garden Network, a broad coalition of agricultural, economic, public health and environmental organizations, the legislative concept (LC 79) will be considered at a hearing before the House Education Committee on January 23, 2008. </p>
<p>LC 79 would create a pilot farm-to-school and school garden program in the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) Child Nutrition Program (CNP). The CNP administers the state’s school meals program and is the sole state agency with the technical expertise and relationships necessary to assist schools, interpret current regulations, and facilitate the purchase of food products that meet state and federal guidelines.</p>
<p>During the regular 2007 legislative session, the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) was authorized to work with Oregon’s agricultural community to capitalize on the purchasing power of K-12 schools around the state. To maximize ODA efforts, it is critical to create and fund a corollary position and program in ODE to work effectively with ODA’s farm-to-school program. The proposed 2008 legislation will fill a critical inter-agency coordination gap so that both state agencies can work effectively with schools around the state to develop farm-to-school programs.</p></blockquote>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2008/01/shopping-around/">Shopping around: organics on a budget</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Betty from our <a href="../../greengroups/index/">GreenGroup</a> is like many of us. She wants to buy organic as much as possible, but the prices can sometimes make it cost prohibitive. Here's her experience:</p><blockquote><p>H/R:&nbsp; In 2008, I want to purchase more organic foods, so I found the following article -- <a href="http://sagemommy.com/organiconabudget.html">Organics on a Budget</a> -- written by a green mom interesting.&nbsp; It made me think about why I have never made it a regular practice to purchase organic foods more consistently in the first place.&nbsp; The first things that usually come to mind are higher prices and having a more difficult time finding organics in the places that I normally shop.&nbsp; I have no idea whether these statements are factually true or not, but because I believed them to true, I hadn't made any effort to disprove them. </p>
<p>When I lived in San Francisco, I thought organic foods were priced much more expensively in comparison to their non-organic counterparts.&nbsp; On my way home from work, I often passed by a small organic store.&nbsp; I never thought to go into it though because of the price issue.&nbsp; Then, over the years, I one day found myself in the store because I was desperately needing an item (probably milk), and decided that it was much easier for me to walk here and get a carton and save lots of time in the process.&nbsp; Even though I might have to pay more for it, I was willing to make the trade-off.&nbsp; Well, much to my pleasant surprise, I remember the milk costing a little bit less than the supermarket that was a 10 minute walk away!&nbsp; So, after this positive experience, I found myself walking to this store more often to get my milk on the way home from work.&nbsp; Then, one thing led to another, and I started buying fruits and vegies there.&nbsp; Over a period of time, as the store began to have more regular shoppers, it seemed to me that the prices slowly started to come down so that they were more comparable to the prices set at chain stores for the same items.</p>
<p>Have you noticed a price decrease in organic products in the time that you have been shopping for organic products?</p></blockquote><p>It would seem that if more people are buying organics, then the prices might come down as organics becomes more the norm. On the flipside, I think I've read that because demand for organics is growing so quickly, the prices may go up to meet demand. I do think there's a lot of value in shopping around. Market of Choice seems to regularly have much lower prices on organic milk than Fred Meyer does (two of my regular shopping haunts). </p>
<p>Do you shop around? What have your experiences with organic food prices been? </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I'm counting the days 'til the release of the movie <a href="http://www.kingcorn.net/"><em>King Corn</em></a> in Portland (<a href="http://www.hollywoodtheatre.org/engaging/coming_soon.html">November 9, at the Hollywood Theatre</a>). I first read about <a href="http://www.edibleportland.com/2007/10/movie_king_corn.html"><em>King Corn</em> a few months ago in <em>Edible Portland</em></a>. Then was really pleased to see the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/foodday/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/1194031540273240.xml&amp;coll=7">interview in the <em>Oregonian's FoodDay</em></a> (of all places) yesterday -- nice to learn that the movies makers' have some connections to Oregon. Here's the synopsis:</p><blockquote><p><em>King Corn</em> is a feature documentary about two friends, one acre of corn, and the subsidized crop that drives our fast-food nation.</p>
<p>In <em>King Corn</em>, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis, best friends from college on the east coast, move to the heartland to learn where their food comes from.&nbsp; With the help of friendly neighbors, genetically modified seeds, and powerful herbicides, they plant and grow a bumper crop of America’s most-productive, most-subsidized grain on one acre of Iowa soil.&nbsp; But when they try to follow their pile of corn into the food system, what they find raises troubling questions about how we eat—and how we farm.</p></blockquote><p>This movie is so timely and relevant, and eye-opening for a lot of folks on how corn-based our food production is in the US. We've also recently heard some strong words from a UN food advocate about how <a href="http://news.opb.org/article/un-calls-converting-food-crops-fuel-crime-against-humanity/">using food to make fuel is a &quot;crime against humanity.&quot;</a> So I guess it's not just me who is bugged every time I hear about a new corn-based clothing fiber or plastic take-out container... (Don't be surprised if you hear me muttering &quot;Corn, why'd it have to be corn...&quot; to myself.)</p>
<p>And if you miss <em>King Corn</em> in the theaters, public television is going to air the movie sometime this spring. I'll post when I get the local broadcast date on that.</p><br/>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/11/first-time-csa-/">First time CSA season in review: the good, the bad and the beets</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>As most of you know, this year Heather and I split a community-supported agriculture (CSA) share from <a href="/">Gathering Together Farm</a> for the first time. In many ways, this share shaped our summer and the harvest season. Each and every Sunday since last June, we've been coordinating schedules to meet at the <a href="http://www.hillsdalefarmersmarket.com/">Hillsdale Farmers Market</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="../../2007/06/communitysuppor/">first box was overwhelming</a>. Heather was on vacation for that one, so I was on my own. I had no idea how big 10-gallons of produce would really be, and I was pretty clueless as to what some of the things were, and what to do with them. Our readers came to the rescue. Hours after I got home, I remembered that the box came with a newsletter. When I read it, I found there was an itemized list, which helped me identify some of the mystery veggies (pea tops?). And we certainly got to try a few new things, including roasted turnips (coated in a bit of olive oil) and tossed with Parmesan cheese. Who'd have guessed a turnip would taste so good? Prior to this box, turnips seemed like something you might only eat in a famine...</p>
<p>Then there was the discovery of the <a href="../../2007/07/found-it-a-sour/">best. chicken. ever</a>. Maybe we could have found this chicken if we weren't going to the Farmers Market every Sunday. Maybe not. Being in the CSA, we had to go to the market every week -- rain or shine -- and that turned out to be a great thing. Every week, we ran into friends and met new and interesting people. We learned things. We tried samples. We connected with our community. Full circle learning moment about how Farmers Markets build community in a way that shopping at a mega-super-grocery store does not (Bill McKibben talked about this at Powells earlier in the year: how we shop at the grocery store in a zombie-like state pushing our carts, avoiding eye-contact with other people, and pretty much buying the same old-same old stuff every week). So yes, the Farmers Market visits impacted the connectedness of our lives. It also helped me to just try things. Prior to this harvest season, I'd go to the Farmers Market, look at all the produce, then not really buy anything. It took me a while to get comfortable there and figure out that the <a href="../../2007/10/working-wonders/">prices of fresh, locally grown food was worth it</a>. </p>
<p>There were highs like my produce-phobe child telling me <a href="../../2007/06/the_worth_of_a_/">she loved carrots</a> and wanted to <a href="../../2007/08/csa-delivers-th/">try watermelon for the first time</a> since infancy; and very rewarding preserving sessions of <a href="../../2007/10/preserving-peac/">peaches</a> and <a href="../../2007/10/making-apple-bu/">apples</a>. There were lows, like Heather being overwhelmed with potatoes and onions, which then led to finding a way to create a <a href="../../2007/10/rooting-it-out/">modern-day root cellar</a>. Another low was sometimes feeling overwhelmed with veggies, and then, horror of horrors, letting some go to waste and having to pitch them into the compost before being able to eat them. </p>
<p>Then there were the beets. Beets were a gag-fest for me as a kid. Nothing would convince me to try one. I think Heather had some veggies she felt the same about. But then, that was the beauty of sharing. We got to foist some things off on each other, but we also got to exchange recipes and elevate one another to a higher level of culinary accomplishment. </p>
<p>The way the CSA worked is we &quot;invested&quot; in the farm in the spring, and picked our box size (full). We paid up front, and designated which market we'd pick our box up at. If you broke it down by week, it was about $20 per week (or $10 per family). But given what Farmers Market prices are usually like, being in the CSA, we went home with far more than you could buy with $10 or $20 worth on any given market day. </p>
<p>So will we do it again? I'd really like to. Heather -- she'll have to tell you herself. It's funny since this was Heather's idea, and I just &quot;went along&quot; at first. But believe you me, I'm a convert now. I think we ate better this summer than we ever have. And the CSA is to thank for it. It's changed my relationship to food.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I'm long overdue to update on a few past posts, so will do so today:</p>
<ul><li>I finally got around to conducting the <a href="../../2007/10/testing-enviro-/">&quot;de-stink Pinky&quot; test</a>. I spritzed Pinky with a half/half mix of vinegar/water and <a href="http://www.ph12-6.com/">PH12.6</a>. PH12.6 worked instantly and left no residual smell. The vinegar water worked but left a residual smell for a while, but then dissipated. This is also one instance where procrastination worked in my favor as untreated areas seem to have lost the campfire smell just from airing out over time. </li>
<li>I <a href="../../2007/10/spreadable-butt/">made the soft butter</a> using a hand-mixer instead of a stand-mixer with no problems and thumbs up from the family. I am not a kitchen whiz, but this was very easy, and no one seems to note any difference in taste from the store-bought in-a-throwaway-plastic-container version. Yay! There's one less plastic item I need to recycle!</li>
<li>This whole thing about <a href="../../2007/10/time-for-a-litt/">reuse of &quot;disposable&quot; baby wipes</a> is beyond cool. Sometimes when I write a post, I'm mostly just trying to be funny and then end up learning something amazing like this. I don't use a lot of baby wipes, but still have enough around, and am thrilled to be tossing them into the hamper for a wash now instead of in the trash. I even made sure during a family discussion last night that everyone understood I was throwing these in the hamper with a purpose, and for them not to think ol' mom has really lost it and is throwing garbage in the hamper.</li>
<li>Cheap-o-Dad continues to ride his bike to work. His new goal is to not gas-up again until Thanksgiving. I am trying not to freak about the horrific recent spate of bike v. truck fatalities in Portland. If there's any good in it, it's that some real discussion has been going on regarding making the roads safer for bike riders.</li>
<li>OPB will feature a special on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/bees/">The Silence of the Bees</a> this Sunday on Nature from 8-9pm. Looks very interesting and worth viewing or taping. Did you know honeybees are responsible for every third bite we eat?</li></ul>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Heather often teases me for being the Cliff Claven-type. Always wanting to chime in with trivial bits of info that I've just come across and am dying to share...</p>
<p>So in that vein... The origin of the jack-o-lantern. Does anyone know? Really, now. Why would anyone in their right mind want to carve a face into a squash rendering it inedible? It just seems so wasteful. And especially with mean or scary looking faces. Then to try and burn the house down by sticking a candle inside. So this is what got me to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=origin+of+the+jack+o+lantern&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">Google-ing &quot;origin of the jack o lantern.&quot;</a> And, thank you Google, the 84,000 links you provided will give me sufficient blog fodder for today. Well, the <a href="http://njnj.essortment.com/jackolantern_reuu.htm">story of the jack-o-lantern is a little too wordy and weird for me</a>, and apparently we have the Irish to thank for it. I was hoping to find a cute little jaunty tale I could share with my children, but given the references to the devil, heaven and hell - I think I'll keep all this Cliff Claven Halloween trivia to myself for a few more years. But I will note that the first jack-o-lanterns were carved out of turnips and potatoes. So Heather could probably share a few <a href="../../2007/10/rooting-it-out/">potatoes</a> with you if you haven't gotten your pumpkins yet... </p>
<p>So let's turn our attention to organic, locally grown pumpkins. And other fun and yummy goings-on:</p>
<ul><li>The Great Pumpkin Event -- Saturday, October 27, 8:30am to 2pm, <a href="http://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/">Portland Farmers Market</a> in the South Park Blocks -- will feature a pumpkin carving contest, samples, and a kids' costume parade.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hillsdalefarmersmarket.com/">Hillsdale Farmers Market</a> -- Sunday, October 28, 10am to 2pm, pumpkin decorating tips.</li>
<li>Fall Forest Festival -- Saturday and Sunday, October 27-28, <a href="http://www.tillamookforestcenter.org/">Tillamook Forest Center</a>, 10am to 4pm -- Vote for the best pumpkin, make a Halloween craft or bat house, and storytelling about spooky forest creatures.</li></ul>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/10/speaking-of-fas/">Speaking of Fast Food Nation...</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>As I've probably mentioned before, Cheap-o-Dad and I do not subscribe to Netflix like most people we know. Why? Because it costs money (as if you had to ask)! Since we pay taxes, and the Multnomah County Library uses that tax money to buy good DVDs for us to watch -- who needs Netflix? We just place online library holds, then wait, and wait, and wait... until it is our turn to check out and watch the movie. As it turns out, the movies in our &quot;queue&quot; this weekend were <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0460792/"><em>Fast Food Nation</em></a> and <em>The Last King of Scotland</em>. </p>
<p>Now while I wouldn't suspect that I fit the ideal demographic for <em>Fast Food Nation</em>, it was a decent movie. I don't think it did very well in the theaters. And that's a shame. Directed by Richard Linklater (of <em>Slacker</em> and <em>Dazed and Confused</em> fame), it had a good cast and fictionalized the story of the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Food_Nation"><em>Fastfood Nation</em></a> taking many of the key concepts from the non-fiction book and working them into a credible, frightening story about the dark side of the fast-food industry. </p>
<p>I know there are friends of mine who refuse to read <em>Fastfood Nation</em>, and likely would probably avoid seeing the movie. And I realize I have my issues where I'd rather stick my head in the sand and just not deal with it. But seeing this movie reinforces for me why I never want my kids eating at the big chain fast-food places. I hope by teaching them now, while they are young, that those places do not make good food, that they will stay away. I'm sure it's harder to convince older kids that fast-food is bad, but if you can't get them to watch this movie, show them <a href="http://www.themeatrix.com/">The Meatrix</a>, a spoof on <em>The Matrix</em> that again summarizes some of the key points in the movie (this was one of the extras on the DVD). </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/10/working-wonders/">Working wonders with a little bit of acreage</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Having recently re-read <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0804115761"><em>A Thousand Acres</em></a>, by Jane Smiley, I was struck by how hard it is to be a farmer: the impossibly long days of physical labor, the whims of weather, the variable prices for harvest yields, the struggle to decide whether to farm organically or to go with the mainstream approach with chemical pesticides, fertilizers and the &quot;bigger is better&quot; mentality.</p>
<p>So it was with delight that I read two features about local families farming organically in the Oregonian this past week: </p>
<ul><li><a href="http://olive-3.live.advance.net/foodday/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/1191614109210660.xml&amp;coll=7">The Zaerpoors of Kookoolan Farms</a>, who are raising organic chickens and eggs in Yamhill. </li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/living/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/1191441306228900.xml&amp;coll=7">Pond family's organic berry farm</a> near the Santiam River.</li></ul>
<p>Both families are heroes in that they are bucking trends. They are younger than the average farmer, working on a smaller scale, and of course going it organic. They acknowledge the gamble of what they are doing. Throwing all their assets into the farm, and well as their time and energies. Kookoolan Farms sells their eggs, chickens and other products at the Hillsdale Farmers' Market, so we've met them, bought their products and have <a href="../../2007/07/pasture-fed-chi/">written glowingly about Kookoolan here before</a>. The Ponds have yet to bring their berries to market. But I have high hopes for them. </p>
<p>I'm sure you sometimes wander the grocery store aisles, and buy things thinking that it's a good, low price. And then you wander the rows of the farmers' market, and again, look for the best prices. And wonder to yourself if it's worth that much... Well, it is. The farmers work hard and deserve our money. When we shop at grocery stores, the farmers are only getting pennies of each dollar we spend. At the farmers' markets, they get it all. And they deserve it! OK. Done preaching to the choir now. </p>

While I've never managed to read Proust's epic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time"><em>Remembrance of Things Past</em></a>, I've managed to hear about the memories evoked from eating the madeleine cakes more times than I can count. Now I've just had a similar experience. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Heather and I met at the farmer's market to pick up and split our <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a> CSA box as we've done pretty much every weekend for the past three months. I'd accidentally left my wallet at home, so was unable to buy extra melons, bread and tomatoes as I'd hoped. Heather had no cash to lend, but did graciously let me take the watermelon that was part of our box. </p>
<p>Having promised my cantaloupe-loving 3-year-old some melon, we cut open the watermelon for dinner. It was glorious. Surprisingly, it was not pink, but yellow. And unlike most watermelons you buy from stores, it had delectable flavor, extreme juiciness, a sweet perfume and loads of black seeds. Eating that watermelon brought me back a good 30 years or so (how did I get this old?). We were talking about how when we were little, watermelon only came once a year. And we'd sit out in the yard, getting all drippy and sticky, and we'd spit the seeds (our parents allowing us to do this, even encouraging us sometimes!). Or we'd tease the little ones saying if they ate the seeds that watermelons would grow in their tummies. It's hard to believe I'd forgotten all that stuff. And harder still to
believe that all this time has passed since I'd eaten a watermelon
tasty enough to evoke it. My kids also marveled at how it was yellow, and that so often the varieties that get sold in stores are selected because they travel well, have been bred to be seedless, or fit a picture of what something is supposed to look like. But taste like crap. Or worse yet, like nothing. That describes most of the melons I've eaten over the past several years (not counting the locally and organically grown ones we've had this year). </p>
<p>One luscious watermelon. Eating all this locally grown produce has helped me realize what summer is all about.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/07/weekend-getaway/">Weekend getaway EnviroMom style</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My mom has been visiting, and very generously offered to watch the kids for a weekend so my husband and I (the self-appointed Cheap-o-Dad) could celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary. So last weekend was our big trip away. Despite seeking advice from <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/02/weekend_getaway.html">ReadySetMom readers on good weekend getaway locales</a>, we ended up not going very far at all. About 12 miles down the road. We drove from Portland to Newberg, OR, which is the starting place of the annual <a href="http://www.vineride.com/">Vineride</a>. Pre-kids, we did a lot of biking. In fabulous far-away places like Tuscany, the south of France, the Netherlands. In the six years since kids, we've probably logged about 12 miles total on our bikes (not counting <a href="../../2007/07/cheap-o-dad-one/">Cheap-o-Dad's recent bike-to-work commutes</a>). The Vineride organizers very generously leave their maps up on their site. We choose the <a href="http://www.vineride.com/bicycle_course.shtm">35-mile option</a>. Of course, we weren't riding on &quot;ride day,&quot; so it was unsupported and we printed our own Google maps. But it was just gorgeous. We saw lush orchards, vineyards, tree farms, farmland, chickens, and one overly zealous guard dog (who warned us that we really shouldn't be biking on his gravel road in city-slick tires). The sun was shining. The humidity was low. We biked past an old-fashioned swimming hole -- something you never would have seen from a car. We lunched at the fabulous French-inspired <a href="http://www.cuveedining.com/">Cuvee</a> in Carlton (on Bastille Day, no less), and met a very nice couple from Boise who seemed to enjoy bike travel as much as we do.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it ended up being 42+ miles (factoring in one wrong turn and one detour). Killer noodle legs at the end of the day, and I nearly told off a cow (yes, as in bovine) to mind her own beeswax as I huffed up the last painful hill into Newberg on granny gear. My point (if there is one) is that like <a href="../../2007/07/a-big-box-o-roc/">Heather wrote since reading <em>Last Child in the Woods</em></a>, there really is a world of wonder just in our own backyard. And if you venture a little further, like, say 12 miles, it's kind of like being in Tuscany (but with lots more pickup trucks and far too many big gulp cups discarded by the side of the road). We never actually made it to any wineries. They all seemed to be atop large hills. But it was lovely. To get a taste of non-city life in a way that I don't on a daily basis. Can't recommend it highly enough. And since we didn't drive very far, Cheap-o-Dad is still on track to not fill up his gas tank all summer! </p>

				<p>Best. Chicken. Ever.</p>
<p>Wondering what real chicken tastes like? Try <a href="../../2007/07/found-it-a-sour/">pasture-fed</a>. Yes, it is more expensive ($17 for 3.75 pounds). But I'm a recent convert to the whole &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; way of thinking. I roasted it for dinner last night (stuffed with garlic and an orange - yum) and have enough left over for a 2nd dinner. Then, for the FIRST TIME EVER, I made my own chicken stock (because I wanted to get every bit of my $17 out of that hen). I tossed the carcass in a soup pot, covered it with water, threw in some farm-fresh carrots and onions, some dried herbs, salt, pepper and simmered it for about four hours. After removing everything I could with a slotted spoon, I ended up with eight cups of tasty stock, which I stored in freezer bags. <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=300,height=200,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/16/camilla_2.jpg"><img title="Camilla_2" height="83" alt="Camilla_2" src="../../images/2007/07/16/camilla_2.jpg" width="125" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px"/></a> </p>

They are only selling at the Hillsdale and McMinnville markets, but anyone can call them up or come out to the farm to buy chickens. <a href="http://www.threesquare.com/">Three Square Grill</a> and <a href="http://www.nostrana.com/">Nostrana</a> also cook with their chickens. Here's the scoop:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Kookoolan Farm's transitional organic, truly free-range, pasture-fed chickens live outdoors, exercising or resting at their pleasure, foraging for bugs and grass as birds should. Certified organic feed. No hormones. No antibiotics. No medications. No cages. No artificial lighting. No confinement. No crowded transportation to slaughter. Contains no retained water from processing.</p>
<p>Our chickens are naturally raised in small flocks of 200 and respectfully hand-processed on the farm where they were raised. Our Oregon Department of Agriculture licensed processing facility is located right on our farm. Our hand-processed chickens are humanely killed, then air-chilled to obtain optimum flavor and texture.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Cost is $3.75 per pound, whole chickens, fresh or frozen. Contact them at 503-662-4742 or kookoolan [at] gmail [dot] com. At the Hillsdale market, their stand is at the very end, closest to Rieke Elementary. In addition, the farm also sells raw cow and goat's milk -- call or email for more info.</p>
<p>Yeehaw! Will this be the best chicken I've ever tasted (if I manage to cook it successfully)? I'll report back...</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Thank you, Carol W, for inspiring me to make <a href="../../2007/06/pledging_loyalt/#comments">strawberry freezer jam</a>. I've made cooked jams in the past. And have loved them, but have avoided it for years now since our lovely children entered our lives. Canning just seemed like way too much time and trouble.</p>
<p>So I was so pleased by your suggestion to make strawberry freezer jam. It was so fast and easy, and everyone in the family loves eating it (even my fruit-o-phobe 5-year old). I now plan to put up a lot of freezer fruit jams this summer, and probably would not have done so otherwise! The fruit-o-phobe even wants to picks blueberries with me when they come into season. All those readings of <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=014050169x"><em>Blueberries for Sal</em></a> seem to have had some impact. Maybe someday she'll even eat one!! Well, at least I feel we're on the right track. I've just started reading <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780060852559">Barbara Kingsolver's <em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</em></a> and am pleased to see even her kids didn't love all fruits and veggies as kids. So there's hope for us too!!</p>

Have you seen <a href="http://www.cowsunite.org/">CowsUnite.org</a>?

It's a humorous, clever concept drafted by an agency to promote the <a href="http://www.organicvalley.coop/">Organic Valley</a> brand of dairy products. But is Organic Valley milk better than competitor Horizon's organic milk? They are both major sellers in the organic dairy space. When a lot of people think organic, they think small, local farm. With major producers of organics like Earthbound Farms, small and local is not what you're getting much of the time. When I think small and local in the dairy domain, <a href="http://www.alpenrose.com/dairy.htm">Alpenrose</a> is the first one that comes to my mind.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Is Organic Valley milk better than other organic milk? Are you brand loyal when it comes to milk? Do funny cows on a web site make you want to know more and buy more? </p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Wouldn't it be great if our kids were served more locally-grown foods in the school cafeteria? Well, there are a few things you can do to show your support for the Food and Farm bill. Check out this ACTION ALERT we received from the <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/farmtoschool/">EcoTrust Food & Farms</a> program:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>We need your help today to get Oregon's Farm to School bills passed. </strong>Key decisions will be made this week. Now is the time to call your legislators in Salem. </p>
<p>Oregon is one of a handful of states that doesn't contribute additional funds to support implementation of the National School Lunch and Breakfast program. Now it's catch up time. Let's improve the quality of food we're serving our kids, while simultaneously supporting Oregon farmers. While we're at it, let's fund school gardens and ensure that children across the state learn that carrots grow in the ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In April, the House Education Committee unanimously sent all three Farm to School bills on to the Joint Ways and Means Committee</strong>. <br/>Why wouldn't they? With no opposition, these are &quot;apple pie&quot; bills. But that doesn't mean it's time to break out the ice cream. These bills, great as they are, won't get passed unless we keep the pressure on to find the money to pay for them! </p>
<p><u>Please contact members of the Joint Ways and Means Committee and show your support.</u><br/>The final frontier for these bills is a funding decision that can only be made by the Joint Ways and Means Committee. The Oregon State Legislature will likely wrap up business at the end of June. Let's make sure our elected officials fund the Farm to School bills before breaking for the summer. </p>
<p>There are four key legislators who need to hear from you: </p>
<p>Senator Kurt Schrader – (D) Canby; Ways and Means Co-Chair, 503-986-1720&nbsp; <a title="blocked::mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us" target="_blank">sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Representative Mary Nolan – (D) SW Portland; Ways and Means Co-Chair, 503-986-1436&nbsp; <a title="blocked::mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us" target="_blank">rep.marynolan@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Senator Richard Devlin – (D) Tualatin; Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources Co-Chair, 503-986-1719 <a title="blocked::mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us" target="_blank">sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Representative Brian Clem – (D) Salem; Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources Co-Chair, 503-986-1421 <a title="blocked::mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us" target="_blank">rep.brianclem@state.or.us</a> (Sponsor of HB 3307 and HB 3185) </p>
<p>Key Messages to Legislators:<br/>(1) The bills (HB 3476, HB 3307, HB 3185) create new market opportunities for Oregon farmers and food processors, fund schools to buy Oregon agricultural products, and support school-based learning gardens. </p>
<p>(2) The bills deserve attention from the Joint Ways and Means Committee ASAP. </p>
<p>(3) The Oregon State Legislature should prioritize and pass all three bills. </p>
<p>How to Make Contact:<br/><u>Call the Legislators Listed Above.</u> Use the phone numbers above to make a personal call. Leave a message with the legislator, staff member, or on the answering service stating the key messages listed above (with bill numbers) and how you can be reached. </p>
<p><u>Send an E-mail.</u> Express your support in an e-mail. Be sure your e-mail includes your home or business address. Specify the bill numbers (see above) and reiterate the key messages above. Personalize your e-mail if possible – why are the bills important to you? </p>
<p><u>Forward this Action Alert.</u> Urge others you may know in the critical districts above to call their legislators. </p>
<p><u>Don't Stop at the Four Above.</u> Call your own legislators, too. Even if they don't sit on the Joint Ways and Means Committee, urge them to keep close track of these bills anyway. Need help with contact information? See the links above. </p>
<p><u>Get Creative</u>: Have your seven year old call, send a note from a high school student, ask the legislator you are contacting what they had for lunch! </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The first time I tasted an Oregon-grown Hood strawberry, I vowed never to eat another Californian strawberry again. The difference was that vast. For those of you who have eaten <a href="http://www.oregon-strawberries.org/sx11/sx11.htm">Hood strawberries</a>, I know you know what I mean. </p>
<p>Today, an <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/editorials/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/1181091488130230.xml&amp;coll=7">Oregonian editorial suggests we, as consumers, should purchase only Oregon strawberries</a>, including processed foods with canned, frozen or preserved berries. It'd cost more, but could help Oregon return as the king in national strawberry production (as we once were 50 years ago). What do you think? </p>
<p>This year's crop ripened earlier than usual, and some of the farms growing strawberries are struggling to find enough pickers. We'd better all do our part and get to some u-pick farms and pick some while they are ripe. What's your favorite u-pick farm for strawberries? Do you eat them all fresh, or do you prefer to preserve these heavenly red berries in jams, by freezing or dehydration?</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Despite having looked forward to the start of our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture">CSA</a> for months, the night before our first box arrived I had a scary dream. You know that movie <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/fant2.html"><em>Fantasia</em> and that sequence of the Sorcerer's Apprentice</a>? It was like that, only with fresh produce. I'd arrive at the <a href="/">Hillsdale Farmers Market</a> to pick up our box of fruits and veggies, only to have more and more fruits and vegetables piling higher and higher, until my re-usable cloth bags were exploding and I was staggering out of the market under a giant pile of delicious, organic, locally grown produce. Not exactly the stuff of true nightmares, but it caused me a bit of anxiety. Heather and I are sharing our box, so my anxiety was compounded knowing that my family would be responsible for consuming all of this fiber-filled goodness on our own (note that my two kids aren't big produce consumers). </p>
<p>As it turned out, I think we'll be able to rally this first week. We made a fabulous salad for dinner last night with mixed greens, carrots, pea tops and strawberries. Here's what was in the first &quot;box of plenty&quot; grown for us by <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a>: </p>

<li>Lettuce - 2 heads</li>
<li>Mountain and green spinach</li>
<li>Purple Viking potatoes</li>
<li>White turnips</li>

</li></ul>
<p>I was so glad they included a nice little newsletter to tell us what was there (because I had no idea on the pea tops, dandelion greens and turnips, having not met any of these kind vegetables before). It also had some recipes, which I will try. But I'd be glad for any more of your ideas on what to do with turnips, rhubarb, pea tops and dandelion greens. </p>

				<p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/18-9781594200823-0">The Omnivore's Dilemma</a> by Michael Pollan, and it's completely blown my mind. I'm not a vegetarian, nor do I intend to become one, but I imagine I'll be cooking less meat from now on. Up until now I've always thought buying &quot;organic, free-range chicken&quot; meant that my chicken had once been out pecking at grubs in the wide outdoors, the wind ruffling its downy feathers. Ha. Free-range simply means that chickens aren't kept in a cage, but they can be kept in a large building (free to roam). Thousands of them. Being fed organic corn, not grubs. Yes, there is a door! To the outside! But these simple-minded animals have never seen the outdoors so they are too scared to go out there. Chances are, my free-range chicken lived its entire seven-week life in a stinky, dark building. How is that natural? (Stepping off of soap-box now...)</p>
<p>I know that <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/dynamicContent.aspx?loc=143&amp;subloc=1&amp;menuId=242&amp;mc=1431">New Seasons' Pacific Village chicken</a> is not pasture-fed -- you can tell by the photos on their Web site. Do you know of a brand or a local store that carries pasture-fed chicken?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When our GreenGroup went to Jen's house we were able to see a permaculture experiment first-hand. I had (and still have) a vague understanding of the theory behind permaculture, so I looked to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">Wikipedia</a> to help me understand a little better. It's basically using nature to create a self-sustaining environment. Renee's earlier chicken analogy works: you grow vegetables to eat; you give the chickens the scraps; the chickens poop, thus fertilizing the soil for the vegetable garden. Jen and her husband have tried to incorporate this idea throughout their home and yard. Large trees shade the (oh-so-green-built) house, which keeps it cool in summer, eliminating the need to use natural resources. Other areas of the yard receive full sun for gardening. They've planted specific trees close together, because one gives off nitrogen that the others need to bear fruit. (Help, Jen, I don't have all the names!) </p>
<p>The feeling I had walking around was that the yard was &quot;working&quot;. Every plant and tree had a job. They've planted a lot of native plants, which require little water and maintenance. If you're interested in seeing permaculture in action, there is actually a demonstration garden at the <a href="http://www.portlandpermaculture.com/index.shtml">Portland Permaculture Institute</a>. They will offer tours to groups of six or more and occasionally have public tours in the summer months. Another great resource is the <a href="http://www.pdxpermaculture.org/index.html">Portland Permaculture Guild</a>, an informal group that holds free monthly educational meetings the third Monday of the month in NE Portland. Have you dabbled in permaculture?</p>

				<p>Our GreenGroup had two meetings last week: Tuesday we met at the SW Community Center, and then Sunday we went to Jen's house and were wowed by her totally green house and experiment in permaculture out in the yard. Here are a few of the things we discussed on Tuesday:</p>
<p>Erin reminded us that <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/">New Seasons</a> sells shampoo, hand soap (and what else -- lotion?) in bulk. You can bring in your own container, have it weighed before you fill it and they will deduct the weight of the container from the total weight. This is a great way to keep plastic containers out of your home and the waste stream.</p>
<p>One of our members just finished <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/17-9780060938451-1">Fast Food Nation</a> and discussed how conventional cattle farming takes up a huge amount of natural resources and energy. Cutting back on (or eliminating) conventionally-raised beef is a good goal to have. <a href="http://www.oregoncountrybeef.com/">Oregon Country Beef</a> is raised far more sustainably (though still not perfect) and is available at Whole Foods and New Seasons.</p>
<p>Kelly and her family are planning a move and are working with a green realtor! I can't remember her name, but she is a former architect who is great at looking at existing homes and figuring out how they can be turned into green homes within the buyer's budget. We will be eagerly following her progress!</p>
<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://www.azurestandard.com/">Azure Standard</a>? It's an online, natural bulk food store based in Dufer, Oregon. If you place a $400 order you can get free delivery. This is a great idea if you want to buy with a group of friends -- or a GreenGroup of friends, as we've been discussing, thanks to Jen!</p>
<p>Betty brought show-and-tell: a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/lights/5a9f/">Forever Flashlight</a>. It requires no batteries -- all you do is shake it and it will shine for 5 minutes. I like this idea because batteries will die even if they aren't being used (like many of our flashlights) and we frequently only need a flashlight for quick uses.</p>
<p>We also spent some time talking about whether we could ever give up toilet paper. One of our members has been pondering the total elimination of paper products. Washcloths and handkerchiefs instead of paper towels, napkins and facial tissues, so what about toilet paper? Is it really any different than using cloth diapers? I think toilet paper is another one of my <a href="../../2007/04/what_are_your_s/">sacred cows</a>, but it will be interesting to see if she tries it. Could you?</p>
<p>Whew. And that was just a little of what we talked about. We'll write a separate post on Jen's place! </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>How do I love thee <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/html/">Burgerville</a>? Let me count the ways.<br/>I love thee for thy committment to sustainable food, both local and fresh<br/>I love thee for thy killer turkey burger and cage-free egss.<br/>My heart yearns for thy seasonal treats like strawberry shortcake,<br/>chocolate hazelnut smoothies and Walla Walla onion rings.<br/>My soul is at peace with thy kid's meal prizes:<br/>trowels and seed packets, wind power reuseable stickers, bug coloring books!<br/>My only grief is that sometimes my kids enjoy playing with the balloons<br/>rather than eating their delicious meals, but alas, who cares?<br/>I love thee in too many ways to count! <br/>I shall love thee next time in prose as clearly I am no poet.</p>
<p>(Apologies to the memory and work of <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/literature/elizabethbarrettbrowning/poems/sonnetsfromtheportuguese/howdoilovetheeletmecounttheways.html">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>).</p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Dark-All-American/dp/0060938455">Fast Food Nation</a> a few years back, we started calling all the fast-food burger joints &quot;pooh-pooh burger.&quot; I wanted to make sure my kids understood never to eat there. They remember that nickname; it's catchy. While we don't eat a lot of burgers and fries, Burgerville has sure given us a tasty alternative to pooh-pooh burger. I was thinking about Burgerville while gardening today -- we really enjoy the little trowels and rakes they provided in their kids meals last summer. What practical, fun prizes! </p>
<p>Well, I could go on and on about Burgerville. But I won't. Because that'll make me hungry. And I promise not to foist any lame poetry on you again anytime soon.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I find myself surrounded by <a href="http://knittinmom.blogspot.com/2007/03/oh-ducks.html">online</a> and <a href="../../2007/03/greengroup_325_/">offline</a> discussions about chickens lately. That's a little terrifying for me, and I'd like to explain.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, growing up in the Chicago suburbs, my folks liked to send me and my brother to visit <a href="http://www.columbus.in.us/listings/index.cfm?action=displayListing&amp;listingID=4601&amp;catID=347&amp;subCatID=3108&amp;startrange=All&amp;endrange=All&amp;substart=M&amp;subend=S&amp;notify=1&amp;ShowTab=0">relatives who owned a farm and produce market in Columbus, Indiana</a>. Ostensibly, it was to let us chew on a little hay and learn about the circle of pastoral life. In reality, I think they were just happy to be rid of us for a few weeks each summer while Uncle Bill and Aunt Shirley filled us up with as much corn on the cob, ribs and black-eyed peas as humanly possible. Except for the effect the grub had on my LDLs, that's not the terrifying part yet. </p>
<p>One day I was hanging out with some of the local teenagers who worked at the produce stand. They were teasing an old rooster named Mort who was strutting around. I had no experience with chickens, but didn't feel it was right to tease him. I tried to get them to stop. I must have been about 7 years old. They didn't stop, and Mort got mad. Ironically, he chose to vent his frustrations on me (probably because I was the smallest).&nbsp; He started pecking after me, and I ran like the devil was on my tail. That rooster chased me around the farmhouse, and Aunt Shirley intervened by the time I'd looped the house once and ran screaming up to the front door. Aunt Shirley was not to be messed with. She told Mort to leave me alone, but not before he pecked on my knees and bloodied me up a bit. Needless to say, I was scarred both physically and mentally by the experience, young suburban girl that I was. It wasn't until I got to university that I learned the word &quot;mort&quot; means &quot;death&quot; in Latin. </p>
<p>So the whole idea of chickens is just beyond me. And apologies for this rambling post, but my point is it's ok if it's beyond you too. If you feel like switching to waxed baggies from plastic is about all you can handle right now, then more power to you -- that's OK! We are all at different stages -- various shades of green -- and all of them are good. Remember to take baby steps. Do what you can, and don't get overwhelmed by things that just don't seem feasible to you. Even though Heather, others in my GreenGroup and lots of new online friends may be harvesting their own eggs soon, let me tell ya', I don't think I'll be getting chickens anytime ever! </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/03/a_funny_thing_h/">A local food conspiracy? Or just dumb luck?</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Four things happened last Sunday that radically changed my mindset about locally-grown foods. It almost felt like a conspiracy the way it all came together. </p>
<p>1. At the <a href="http://www.hillsdalefarmersmarket.com/">Hillsdale Winter Famers' Market</a> I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.edibleportland.com/">Edible Portland</a>, a gorgeous magazine <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=155,height=134,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/03/16/edibleportland_2.jpg"></a>that<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=155,height=134,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/03/16/edibleportland.jpg"></a>&nbsp; celebrates the bounty of fresh foods produced in the area. Short articles focusing on Spring recipes (finally, an explanation of the mysterious fava bean!) and cooking techniques, interviews with farmers -- it gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling about how lucky we are to live in a region chock-full of good food. The magazine is FREE, but it goes fast. You can find it <a href="http://www.edibleportland.com/pages/advertisers.htm">here</a> or via subscription (it's worth it).</p>
<p>2. Later in the day I came upon <a href="http://www.truecostoffood.org/truecostoffood/">this online video produced by the Sierra Club</a> about the 'true' cost of food when it is grown on a factory-type farm and shipped thousands of miles. I don't know what it was (maybe the threatening, gnarly old woman-narrator) but it made me feel sick about the state of conventional farming. (I had to watch the low-resolution video because the high-res kept freezing midway through.) </p>
<p>3. The video affected me so much that I picked up the phone and called Renee. At the market I'd mindlessly grabbed a flyer for a local farm's <a href="http://www.pacsac.org/">Community Supported Agriculture</a> (CSA) program and was now pouring over it. Would she like to split a box of fresh, organic, locally-grown produce with me once a week? Yes. </p>
<p>4. New Seasons had just become a site sponsor over at <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/">ReadySetMom.com</a>, so I thought I'd check out their new <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/">online shopping</a>. New Seasons is a huge supporter of locally-grown foods, and I filled my cart with products from regional farms. You can read my full shopping review <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/03/trying_out_onli.html">here</a>. Suffice it to say, it was a great experience, I think I'm going to save money on groceries, and support a great business.</p>
<p>I don't think it's possible to exclusively buy locally-grown food, but it seems that we have the good fortune to have so much selection in so many places. What do you think? Do you enjoy shopping at farmers' markets? Is buying local foods something you'd like to do more of, or do you feel that it's too expensive or too time-consuming to shop for it?</p>
