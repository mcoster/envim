		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Having recently re-read <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0804115761"><em>A Thousand Acres</em></a>, by Jane Smiley, I was struck by how hard it is to be a farmer: the impossibly long days of physical labor, the whims of weather, the variable prices for harvest yields, the struggle to decide whether to farm organically or to go with the mainstream approach with chemical pesticides, fertilizers and the &quot;bigger is better&quot; mentality.</p>
<p>So it was with delight that I read two features about local families farming organically in the Oregonian this past week: </p>
<ul><li><a href="http://olive-3.live.advance.net/foodday/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/1191614109210660.xml&amp;coll=7">The Zaerpoors of Kookoolan Farms</a>, who are raising organic chickens and eggs in Yamhill. </li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/living/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/1191441306228900.xml&amp;coll=7">Pond family's organic berry farm</a> near the Santiam River.</li></ul>
<p>Both families are heroes in that they are bucking trends. They are younger than the average farmer, working on a smaller scale, and of course going it organic. They acknowledge the gamble of what they are doing. Throwing all their assets into the farm, and well as their time and energies. Kookoolan Farms sells their eggs, chickens and other products at the Hillsdale Farmers' Market, so we've met them, bought their products and have <a href="../../../2007/07/pasture-fed-chi/">written glowingly about Kookoolan here before</a>. The Ponds have yet to bring their berries to market. But I have high hopes for them. </p>
<p>I'm sure you sometimes wander the grocery store aisles, and buy things thinking that it's a good, low price. And then you wander the rows of the farmers' market, and again, look for the best prices. And wonder to yourself if it's worth that much... Well, it is. The farmers work hard and deserve our money. When we shop at grocery stores, the farmers are only getting pennies of each dollar we spend. At the farmers' markets, they get it all. And they deserve it! OK. Done preaching to the choir now. </p>

While I've never managed to read Proust's epic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time"><em>Remembrance of Things Past</em></a>, I've managed to hear about the memories evoked from eating the madeleine cakes more times than I can count. Now I've just had a similar experience. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Heather and I met at the farmer's market to pick up and split our <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a> CSA box as we've done pretty much every weekend for the past three months. I'd accidentally left my wallet at home, so was unable to buy extra melons, bread and tomatoes as I'd hoped. Heather had no cash to lend, but did graciously let me take the watermelon that was part of our box. </p>
<p>Having promised my cantaloupe-loving 3-year-old some melon, we cut open the watermelon for dinner. It was glorious. Surprisingly, it was not pink, but yellow. And unlike most watermelons you buy from stores, it had delectable flavor, extreme juiciness, a sweet perfume and loads of black seeds. Eating that watermelon brought me back a good 30 years or so (how did I get this old?). We were talking about how when we were little, watermelon only came once a year. And we'd sit out in the yard, getting all drippy and sticky, and we'd spit the seeds (our parents allowing us to do this, even encouraging us sometimes!). Or we'd tease the little ones saying if they ate the seeds that watermelons would grow in their tummies. It's hard to believe I'd forgotten all that stuff. And harder still to
believe that all this time has passed since I'd eaten a watermelon
tasty enough to evoke it. My kids also marveled at how it was yellow, and that so often the varieties that get sold in stores are selected because they travel well, have been bred to be seedless, or fit a picture of what something is supposed to look like. But taste like crap. Or worse yet, like nothing. That describes most of the melons I've eaten over the past several years (not counting the locally and organically grown ones we've had this year). </p>
<p>One luscious watermelon. Eating all this locally grown produce has helped me realize what summer is all about.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My mom has been visiting, and very generously offered to watch the kids for a weekend so my husband and I (the self-appointed Cheap-o-Dad) could celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary. So last weekend was our big trip away. Despite seeking advice from <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/02/weekend_getaway.html">ReadySetMom readers on good weekend getaway locales</a>, we ended up not going very far at all. About 12 miles down the road. We drove from Portland to Newberg, OR, which is the starting place of the annual <a href="http://www.vineride.com/">Vineride</a>. Pre-kids, we did a lot of biking. In fabulous far-away places like Tuscany, the south of France, the Netherlands. In the six years since kids, we've probably logged about 12 miles total on our bikes (not counting <a href="../../../2007/07/cheap-o-dad-one/">Cheap-o-Dad's recent bike-to-work commutes</a>). The Vineride organizers very generously leave their maps up on their site. We choose the <a href="http://www.vineride.com/bicycle_course.shtm">35-mile option</a>. Of course, we weren't riding on &quot;ride day,&quot; so it was unsupported and we printed our own Google maps. But it was just gorgeous. We saw lush orchards, vineyards, tree farms, farmland, chickens, and one overly zealous guard dog (who warned us that we really shouldn't be biking on his gravel road in city-slick tires). The sun was shining. The humidity was low. We biked past an old-fashioned swimming hole -- something you never would have seen from a car. We lunched at the fabulous French-inspired <a href="http://www.cuveedining.com/">Cuvee</a> in Carlton (on Bastille Day, no less), and met a very nice couple from Boise who seemed to enjoy bike travel as much as we do.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it ended up being 42+ miles (factoring in one wrong turn and one detour). Killer noodle legs at the end of the day, and I nearly told off a cow (yes, as in bovine) to mind her own beeswax as I huffed up the last painful hill into Newberg on granny gear. My point (if there is one) is that like <a href="../../../2007/07/a-big-box-o-roc/">Heather wrote since reading <em>Last Child in the Woods</em></a>, there really is a world of wonder just in our own backyard. And if you venture a little further, like, say 12 miles, it's kind of like being in Tuscany (but with lots more pickup trucks and far too many big gulp cups discarded by the side of the road). We never actually made it to any wineries. They all seemed to be atop large hills. But it was lovely. To get a taste of non-city life in a way that I don't on a daily basis. Can't recommend it highly enough. And since we didn't drive very far, Cheap-o-Dad is still on track to not fill up his gas tank all summer! </p>

				<p>Best. Chicken. Ever.</p>
<p>Wondering what real chicken tastes like? Try <a href="../../../2007/07/found-it-a-sour/">pasture-fed</a>. Yes, it is more expensive ($17 for 3.75 pounds). But I'm a recent convert to the whole &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; way of thinking. I roasted it for dinner last night (stuffed with garlic and an orange - yum) and have enough left over for a 2nd dinner. Then, for the FIRST TIME EVER, I made my own chicken stock (because I wanted to get every bit of my $17 out of that hen). I tossed the carcass in a soup pot, covered it with water, threw in some farm-fresh carrots and onions, some dried herbs, salt, pepper and simmered it for about four hours. After removing everything I could with a slotted spoon, I ended up with eight cups of tasty stock, which I stored in freezer bags. <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=300,height=200,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/16/camilla_2.jpg"><img title="Camilla_2" height="83" alt="Camilla_2" src="../../../images/2007/07/16/camilla_2.jpg" width="125" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px"/></a> </p>

Here's the scoop:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Kookoolan Farm's transitional organic, truly free-range, pasture-fed chickens live outdoors, exercising or resting at their pleasure, foraging for bugs and grass as birds should. Certified organic feed. No hormones. No antibiotics. No medications. No cages. No artificial lighting. No confinement. No crowded transportation to slaughter. Contains no retained water from processing.</p>
<p>Our chickens are naturally raised in small flocks of 200 and respectfully hand-processed on the farm where they were raised. Our Oregon Department of Agriculture licensed processing facility is located right on our farm. Our hand-processed chickens are humanely killed, then air-chilled to obtain optimum flavor and texture.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Cost is $3.75 per pound, whole chickens, fresh or frozen. Contact them at 503-662-4742 or kookoolan [at] gmail [dot] com. At the Hillsdale market, their stand is at the very end, closest to Rieke Elementary. In addition, the farm also sells raw cow and goat's milk -- call or email for more info.</p>
<p>Yeehaw! Will this be the best chicken I've ever tasted (if I manage to cook it successfully)? I'll report back...</p>

				<p>You pay taxes, right? And you like organic food? If so, you might want to let Congress know your wishes about supporting organic farming with your tax dollars. Sign the <a href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/ewgroup/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=630">Environmental Working Group's petition</a> by July 15, 2007. They need about 5,000 more signatures. Congress is near voting on the 2007 Farm Bill. Don't let all of your tax dollars go toward non-organic factory farms. Let your voice be heard!!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Thank you, Carol W, for inspiring me to make <a href="../../../2007/06/pledging_loyalt/#comments">strawberry freezer jam</a>. I've made cooked jams in the past. And have loved them, but have avoided it for years now since our lovely children entered our lives. Canning just seemed like way too much time and trouble.</p>
<p>So I was so pleased by your suggestion to make strawberry freezer jam. It was so fast and easy, and everyone in the family loves eating it (even my fruit-o-phobe 5-year old). I now plan to put up a lot of freezer fruit jams this summer, and probably would not have done so otherwise! The fruit-o-phobe even wants to picks blueberries with me when they come into season. All those readings of <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=014050169x"><em>Blueberries for Sal</em></a> seem to have had some impact. Maybe someday she'll even eat one!! Well, at least I feel we're on the right track. I've just started reading <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780060852559">Barbara Kingsolver's <em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</em></a> and am pleased to see even her kids didn't love all fruits and veggies as kids. So there's hope for us too!!</p>

				<p>It's like a page out of <a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=1-9780689832130-0">Click Clack Moo: Cows that Type</a>. Have you seen <a href="http://www.cowsunite.org/">CowsUnite.org</a>? Launched Monday, these activist cows invite you into their barn, and hope that you read the bovine bill of rights and the history of the cow movement. It's a humorous, clever concept drafted by an agency to promote the <a href="http://www.organicvalley.coop/">Organic Valley</a> brand of dairy products. But is Organic Valley milk better than competitor Horizon's organic milk? They are both major sellers in the organic dairy space. When a lot of people think organic, they think small, local farm. With major producers of organics like Earthbound Farms, small and local is not what you're getting much of the time. When I think small and local in the dairy domain, <a href="http://www.alpenrose.com/dairy.htm">Alpenrose</a> is the first one that comes to my mind.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Is Organic Valley milk better than other organic milk? Are you brand loyal when it comes to milk? Do funny cows on a web site make you want to know more and buy more? </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Wouldn't it be great if our kids were served more locally-grown foods in the school cafeteria? Well, there are a few things you can do to show your support for the Food and Farm bill. Check out this ACTION ALERT we received from the <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/farmtoschool/">EcoTrust Food & Farms</a> program:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>We need your help today to get Oregon's Farm to School bills passed. </strong>Key decisions will be made this week. Now is the time to call your legislators in Salem. </p>
<p>Oregon is one of a handful of states that doesn't contribute additional funds to support implementation of the National School Lunch and Breakfast program. Now it's catch up time. Let's improve the quality of food we're serving our kids, while simultaneously supporting Oregon farmers. While we're at it, let's fund school gardens and ensure that children across the state learn that carrots grow in the ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In April, the House Education Committee unanimously sent all three Farm to School bills on to the Joint Ways and Means Committee</strong>. <br/>Why wouldn't they? With no opposition, these are &quot;apple pie&quot; bills. But that doesn't mean it's time to break out the ice cream. These bills, great as they are, won't get passed unless we keep the pressure on to find the money to pay for them! </p>
<p><u>Please contact members of the Joint Ways and Means Committee and show your support.</u><br/>The final frontier for these bills is a funding decision that can only be made by the Joint Ways and Means Committee. The Oregon State Legislature will likely wrap up business at the end of June. Let's make sure our elected officials fund the Farm to School bills before breaking for the summer. </p>
<p>There are four key legislators who need to hear from you: </p>
<p>Senator Kurt Schrader – (D) Canby; Ways and Means Co-Chair, 503-986-1720&nbsp; <a title="blocked::mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us" target="_blank">sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Representative Mary Nolan – (D) SW Portland; Ways and Means Co-Chair, 503-986-1436&nbsp; <a title="blocked::mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us" target="_blank">rep.marynolan@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Senator Richard Devlin – (D) Tualatin; Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources Co-Chair, 503-986-1719 <a title="blocked::mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us" target="_blank">sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Representative Brian Clem – (D) Salem; Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources Co-Chair, 503-986-1421 <a title="blocked::mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us" target="_blank">rep.brianclem@state.or.us</a> (Sponsor of HB 3307 and HB 3185) </p>
<p>Key Messages to Legislators:<br/>(1) The bills (HB 3476, HB 3307, HB 3185) create new market opportunities for Oregon farmers and food processors, fund schools to buy Oregon agricultural products, and support school-based learning gardens. </p>
<p>(2) The bills deserve attention from the Joint Ways and Means Committee ASAP. </p>
<p>(3) The Oregon State Legislature should prioritize and pass all three bills. </p>
<p>How to Make Contact:<br/><u>Call the Legislators Listed Above.</u> Use the phone numbers above to make a personal call. Leave a message with the legislator, staff member, or on the answering service stating the key messages listed above (with bill numbers) and how you can be reached. </p>
<p><u>Send an E-mail.</u> Express your support in an e-mail. Be sure your e-mail includes your home or business address. Specify the bill numbers (see above) and reiterate the key messages above. Personalize your e-mail if possible – why are the bills important to you? </p>
<p><u>Forward this Action Alert.</u> Urge others you may know in the critical districts above to call their legislators. </p>
<p><u>Don't Stop at the Four Above.</u> Call your own legislators, too. Even if they don't sit on the Joint Ways and Means Committee, urge them to keep close track of these bills anyway. Need help with contact information? See the links above. </p>
<p><u>Get Creative</u>: Have your seven year old call, send a note from a high school student, ask the legislator you are contacting what they had for lunch! </p>
<p><u>Sign up for Additional Action Alerts</u>: <br/>Visit <a onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://whatcounts.com/t?r=915&amp;c=951523&amp;l=37310&amp;ctl=17BC67E:9E47577DB96EEB3A80B8C8289600E1827DDB2469356655AC" target="_blank">www.ecotrust.org/farmtoschool</a> for more information and to sign up for additional action alerts. </p></blockquote>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The first time I tasted an Oregon-grown Hood strawberry, I vowed never to eat another Californian strawberry again. The difference was that vast. For those of you who have eaten <a href="http://www.oregon-strawberries.org/sx11/sx11.htm">Hood strawberries</a>, I know you know what I mean. </p>
<p>Today, an <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/editorials/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/1181091488130230.xml&amp;coll=7">Oregonian editorial suggests we, as consumers, should purchase only Oregon strawberries</a>, including processed foods with canned, frozen or preserved berries. It'd cost more, but could help Oregon return as the king in national strawberry production (as we once were 50 years ago). What do you think? </p>
<p>This year's crop ripened earlier than usual, and some of the farms growing strawberries are struggling to find enough pickers. We'd better all do our part and get to some u-pick farms and pick some while they are ripe. What's your favorite u-pick farm for strawberries? Do you eat them all fresh, or do you prefer to preserve these heavenly red berries in jams, by freezing or dehydration?</p>
