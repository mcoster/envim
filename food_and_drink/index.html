I had the pleasure of living in the south of France for one year while I was a college student. I could go on and on about the culture, food and arts of this fine country, but I won't. Today I want to talk about mustard packaging. Look closely at this photo. You may think you are looking at the glass of milk that my daughter didn't finish from breakfast. And you are. But you are also looking at a jar that once held a commercially produced quantity of Dijon mustard that I bought ages ago at a French retailer and grocery store called <a href="http://www.monoprix.fr/">Monoprix</a>. I love Dijon mustard for its spicy kick and ability to clear my sinuses. But I also fell in love with the way it was commonly packaged when I was living in France in 1988. You could buy it in glass jars that look exactly like juice glasses when you remove the label and finish the mustard. There is no screw top. There was no plastic safety seal. The lid was a sort of rubbery cap that popped on and off kind of like the covers for the lenses of a pair of binoculars (hopefully that makes sense -- it's the only thing I can think to compare it to). Now this cup has a design with Native Americans on it (and that is particularly why it is the most popular drinking glass in our home -- the kids fight over who gets this cup daily). </p>
<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/26/dijonsqueezer.jpg"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" src="../../images/2008/03/26/dijonsqueezer.jpg" title="Dijonsqueezer" alt="Dijonsqueezer" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>Most of the other mustard jars/glasses I bought during my year in France were clear glass, with no designs. I had no plans to have kids when I was 21 and living in France, so buying kid-themed glasses had no appeal for me at the time. They also came in bigger sizes -- short glasses about the same height at the one pictured, but wider -- like a &quot;on-the-rocks&quot; glass. I don't know if regular French people use them as drinking glasses. As I student, my roommate and I did. Sadly, I've broken all the rest of them over the years, and all that remains is this one &quot;Hopis&quot; glass. </p>
<p>I don't recommend that you travel to France to buy a caseload of Dijon to stock your cupboards with mustard-jar glassware. I don't even know if they still package mustard this way in France. But I do think it's important to see that there are better packaging options than how I typically see Dijon mustard packaged in the US. Food for thought.

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Making a &quot;love connection&quot; between food and kids is such a tricky business. You want your kids to eat healthy foods (and if you read the news, a new definition of what constitutes &quot;healthy&quot; is introduced just about every other day). You want them to eat foods that are whole and natural with not too much sugar. You want them to eat foods that don't have an excessive amount of packaging. But most of all, you want them to eat foods they will <strong><em>eat,</em></strong> instead of look at you blankly when you make snack suggestions with an expression that says: &quot;Really? That's all you have? I'd rather starve and be crabby for the rest of the afternoon than eat those healthy, eco-friendly, crummy snacks...&quot; </p>
<p>One thing that has made my life easier recently is that my older daughter is in school all day, so I usually only take my 3-year-old to the grocery store. That greatly cuts down on the &quot;gimme-gimme-buy-me&quot; mantra. However, that doesn't stop my older daughter from asking for various snacks that I'm not excited to buy. The most recent request was for string cheese. I avoided buying it for a while by simply &quot;forgetting,&quot; but really just avoiding. Then she pestered me, and finally I decided to make my own string cheese. Pretty easy: buy a big hunk of mozzarella cheese and cut off slices day by day, and pack in durable snack container for school. The verdict: she loves it. She seems to appreciate that we can cut it into any shape we want rather than that pre-packaged uniform stick shape. </p>
<p>Next thing we need to kick: wogurt slurps. This is not something I would have normally bought. But we had friends visit with a cooler full of &quot;travel food&quot; last summer. And go-gurts left a major impression on my younger daughter. She was dying to have them. So I found a brand that didn't have HFCS, and she looooved them. She was addicted for a while. Slowly I've started &quot;forgetting&quot; to buy them, and she is forgetting to ask for them. So the yogurt the kids consume is returning to our old faithful Nancy's buckets again. But perhaps this summer, I'll try to find a was to make my own yogurt slurps... Has anyone tried this with any success, maybe using those home-made popsicle containers?</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2008/03/reclaiming-dinn/">Reclaiming dinnertime</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Please forgive us if we start to sound like the apostles of Michael Pollan. Heather and I both recently read <em>In Defense of Food</em>,
and it really rocked our food worlds. My husband is now reading my
copy, so hopefully he'll soon be clear on why I've been suggesting so
many changes around eating time lately. </p>
<p>A few days ago, I called for a family meeting after dinner. The kids
feared they were in trouble, and that I was going to lay down the law
on various things. We were all starving hungry that night, and crabby,
so we ate first, then talked. It gave me time to figure out what
exactly I wanted to talk about, instead of just going on a rant. We
ultimately began by discussing everything that needs to happen to get
dinner onto the table every night. My 6-year-old loved it: raising her
hand to answer just about every question I asked:</p>
<ul><li>Who goes to the store to buy the food?</li>
<li>Who cooks the food?</li>
<li>Who sets the table?</li>
<li>Who pours the drinks?</li>
<li>Who does the dishes?</li>
<li>Who has to beat the children off with a stick saying: &quot;dinner's not
ready yet, we have to wait until your daddy gets home, and no you can't
have a snack right before we sit down the dinner&quot;?</li></ul>
<p>In our family, the correct answer to all the questions is: mom. Yes,
me. How did that happen? I don't think of myself as anything more than
a competent cook, and I'm not a control freak. But somehow I've fallen
into a trap of thinking that's its easier to get it done without the
children under foot... So we decided after our meeting to make some
changes. The kids are now in charge of setting the table, pouring the
drinks and helping carry their plates to the table and to the sink
after mealtime. It takes a lot of prompting. Next phase, the kids need
to be more involved in the choosing what we eat and cooking as well. <br/>
 </p>
<p>Now, I'm not ready to have our kids start <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2008/02/welcome-to-the.html">eating all of our meals in the dining room like Heather has</a>
(mostly for fear of too much spilled milk on the nice rug). But I will
say that increasing everyone's involvement has taken some of the
pressure off of me, and has magically gotten us more connected at
dinnertime. I was under a false impression that because we always sat
down to eat together, that we had that battle won. What I didn't
realize was that it doesn't really count if everyone's just eating and
talking, but not really listening and relating. We even said a little
prayer of gratitude after our meal, which the kids really seemed to
like. </p>
<p>How involved are your children in preparing, serving and cleaning up after meals? Do you pray or give thanks at each meal? Do you feel your family savors the food and family time connecting at meals, or is there room for improvement at your table?<br/> </p>

I've been trying to be a lot more conscious about the food I buy -- avoiding packaged foods and searching out organic and local foods. Until about six months ago I always shopped at Fred Meyer, a Kroger-owned chain here in Portland. But I became less enthralled with the paltry selection of natural meats and local produce. So I switched to <a href="http://newseasonsmarket.com/">New Seasons</a>, a locally-owned chain that works with regional farmers to bring fresh foods to market, as well as offering the full-service grocery experience. I assumed that my grocery bill would skyrocket since you tend to pay a premium for quality, organic foods. But my bill has stayed consistently around $175 per week. (I think the FDA states that a typical family of four can eat nutritionally for $150 per week, but I also think the government just needs to butt out of my pantry...sorry, I digress.) Does $175 a week seem high?</p>
<p>My only conclusion for why I'm spending the same amount is that I'm far more careful about the food I buy at New Seasons than I was at Fred Meyer. I frequently shop online at New Seasons, which makes it really easy to avoid 'impulse' buys, plus I can walk to the kitchen to make sure I don't buy stuff I already have. (It may seem like a conflict of interest to speak glowingly about one of our site sponsors, but I really, really love their service and selection.) I do buy a few extras, like two bottles of wine each week, good coffee beans, yummy cheeses and Greek olives (an addiction). But my cart primarily contains produce, meat, dairy items, breads and spreads and bulk foods.</p>
<p>What are you spending on groceries? Are you buying a lot of organic food, and do you feel like you are spending a whole lot more? Have any good tips for slimming down the grocery bill? (Aside from giving up my glass-of-wine-with-dinner habit?)</p>

				<p>New York has <a href="http://noimpactman.typepad.com/">No Impact Man.</a> The Portland Metro area has Monique Dupre. Monique's mission is to teach <a href="http://www.sustainablebudget.com/">sustainable living on a budget</a>, and how to live without shopping at supermarkets. </p>
<p>I'll confess that at first all this sounded like a bit too much for me. I'll stick with <a href="../../2008/02/jumping-back-in/">my seasonal CSA</a> and shopping the perimeter of the supermarket. But I must say I'm warming to the idea. At least there is a lot more I can learn. At Heather's recommendation, I've just started reading <a href="../../2008/02/i-heart-michael/">Pollan's <em>In Defense of Food</em></a>. Like most of us Americans, my family lacks a food culture. We pick and choose: a little Asian here, a little German there, a whole lot of nutritionizing, mixed in with some worry and stress, and not a whole lot of actual food enjoyment. </p>
<p>So I was very pleased to share a cup of tea this morning with one friend who just took Monique's Intro course, and one friend who is planning to take it. Monique's workshops are very reasonable ($25 a pop). Alternately, you can host a workshop at your house with a minimum of 6 friends, and then your tuition is free. My other friend is signed up to attend the <a href="http://www.sustainablebudget.com/?q=node/6">Introduction course on February 27</a>, which may get canceled if they don't get enough people. So if you are interested, that would be a great one to sign up for!</p>
<p>What was most interesting about our talk this morning is that all of us moms are feeling there's plenty we have to learn on how to feed our families healthy, safe food that is also easy on the environment. And that <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2008/02/my-daughter-and.html">moms need the support of one another</a> to make big changes. I was pleased to hear my friend Kim say that she thinks what she learned from Monique's workshops can be implemented into her family life using baby steps. Thank goodness for that, since that's the foundation of what EnviroMom is about: baby steps. It's easy to get overwhelmed, but together we can make positive changes. And it sounds like we may be on the verge of forming a green food group. Since food is such a major part of green living.</p>

Our culture has become obsessed with Nutritionism, which focuses on the nutrients of food rather than the whole food itself. Packaged foods boast claims of 'loaded with vitamins! omega-3! whole grains!' when in reality these foods break down in our bodies as glucose, and we end up eating more and more because we never feel satisfied. We're busy worrying that we're not getting enough fiber or we're eating too many carbs, when we should be thinking about the food itself, how we eat it, where we eat it and from where it comes.</p>
<p>Pollan delves into the history of processed foods, and it is both fascinating and frustrating. Big money is being made at the expense of the population's health, and the poor suffer the most because the food is so cheap and so unhealthy. Most of the food Americans eat is fast -- either from a restaurant or a box popped into the microwave. We have no 'food culture' in the US that celebrates food (think about the French, Italians, Japanese) where every meal is eaten slowly with other people and savored. He offers suggestions for how we can change our own approach to mealtimes, shopping and cooking.</p>
<p>The book is not long, and Pollan has such an engaging writing style that even a reluctant reader could really get into it. I'm still processing it and trying to figure out how to apply it to my own family. My husband is reading it next, and I'm anxious to discuss it with him. Lucky for Portland, <a href="http://www.edibleportland.com/2008/01/feb_12_event_mi.html">Michael Pollan will be in town next week</a> (thank you, Powell's) to discuss his book: Tuesday, February 12 at 7pm at the Bagdad Theater (SE 37th & Hawthorne). Tickets are $21.95, which includes a copy of the book, and are available through <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/">Ticketmaster</a>, the Bagdad or Crystal Ballroom box offices. See you there?!</p>
<p>(And here's a nice, long excerpt from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=7c85a1c254546157&amp;ex=1327640400">NY Times</a>.)</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2008/02/jumping-back-in/">Jumping back in the pool: CSA the second time around</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last year, Heather and I decided to subscribe to the <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a> Community Supported Agriculture program without a lot of forethought. At the time when we signed up last spring, we were fairly new on our green journey, excitedly trying new things. Joining a CSA seemed like the right thing to do. We'd split a full box and pick it up weekly at the Hillsdale Farmers' Market. What we found was that being in the CSA had its <a href="../../2007/11/first-time-csa-/">highs and lows</a>. So there was <em>much discussion</em> this year on whether we would do it again. Gathering Together Farm lets last year's subscribers enroll before opening it to the general public. Although we went down the wire on our decision, ultimately we decided to go for it. There's no question that the CSA produce we ate last summer was the tastiest, healthiest we had ever had. There was a lovely feeling of community in meeting each weekend at our local farmer's market, running into old friends, meeting new ones. But there was also the frustration of having onions, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and squash coming out of our ears at times. We felt like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wp3m1vg06Q">Lucy and Ethel trying to keep up with the chocolates in that famous assembly line episode</a>. </p>
<p>But I do think we learned some important lessons. The most valuable: prep and freeze in small batches for the winter. Michelle told us that she'd take her box home every Sunday (our designated pickup day) and chop, prep and freeze everything she didn't think her family would eat that week. What a revelation. I had got myself all hyped to do big canning jobs, but when it came down to it, really didn't have the time or energy to do that. When I tried Michelle's approach and chopped and froze small portions of produce, it worked. I can't tell you how happy I've been to pop a chopped pepper out of the freezer and throw it into a curry I'm making for dinner. </p>
<p>The other thing we learned is that we have to be ready. We had grand visions of preserving fresh berries by dehydration. But come berry season -- which really sneaks up on you -- we didn't have a dehydrator. We hadn't researched one. Which one was the best? Gosh, did we really want to add another appliance to our appliance-filled kitchens? Would we really use it? How would we store our dehydrated produce once we'd dried it? A case of analysis paralysis. Flash back to the scene of Lucy and Ethel. My family was buying and eating fresh berries as fast as our local farmers could grow them. Then it was melons. And the squash and tomatoes and pepper piles were piling up. So, it just never happened. </p>
<p>This year will be different. I'm researching that dehydrator now. So I'm excited about our next CSA season. And happy to know that we've inspired lots of friends to take that plunge, and join a CSA of their own. Are you new to joys of CSA? What are some of the valuable lessons you've learned, that you'd like to share?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>You get a bunch of kids together for snack time and usually you want it to be quick and painless -- no fuss, no mess. But convenience foods generally translate into lots of waste. Susan wants to find ways to make her playgroup a little more green:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>I stumbled onto your website and wanted to ask a question regarding playgroups here in Atlanta.&nbsp; We host one every Friday in our neighborhood.&nbsp; We have about 25-30 kids on any given Friday.&nbsp; We rotate providing snacks and drinks for the kids.&nbsp; We seem to create a lot of trash...juice boxes, wrappers from the straws, not to mention the the snack bag.&nbsp; Can you give us an idea of how to make playgroup more green?<br/> <br/>Should we reuse cups?&nbsp; One person would have to wash them, but does that creat more water run off etc?&nbsp; Is paper the way to go or is that wasteful? Any help would be appreciated.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">This is such a great topic to explore! While I can't quite wrap my brain around having 30 kids in my home, I know our clever EnviroMom community can brainstorm some waste-reduction solutions. Here's one: what if each child brought their own durable cup from home and you served juice from bottles rather than individual boxes? Then the cup goes home with the child and one person isn't stuck washing 30 cups. The juice bottles can be recycled, et voila, you've eliminated a huge amount of landfill waste. </p>
<p dir="ltr">OK, EnviroMoms, how else can Susan's playgroup snacktime waste be reduced or eliminated? </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In my six plus years of being a mom, I feel like I spend a lot of time breaking bad habits that I made the mistake of condoning in the first place. Did you give your kids M&Ms as a reward for using the potty? I did. They don't ask for them anymore, but thank goodness. Yet it sure did take a long while to break them of that habit... I cringe to think of it now.</p>
<p>One area where I feel I made the right choice the first time was with soft drinks. I had a zero tolerance policy. Lucky for us, we practice what we preach these days. My husband used to have a thing for root beer. Mine was for diet Coke. But after a while, for whatever reasons. We stopped drinking them. Empty calories, or caffeine I needed to learn to live without. Brown, expensive, fizzy water that blackens your teeth. So the kids have never really tasted it. At least there's one habit I won't have to break...</p>
<p>Yet, I wonder if we're in the minority on this one. We're commonly asked at restaurants if the kids would like a soft drink with their meal. And I certainly see lots of kids chugging down the big gulps. So I'm very interested in the results of this survey <a href="mailto:amanda@enviroblog.org">Amanda</a>, from the Environmental Working Group, just told us about:</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://www.ewg.org/drinksurvey">EWG is surveying parents on their kid's soft drink consumption</a> as a way to gather data about routine exposures to common soft drink ingredients. It's a short survey, and anyone who takes it will get a free update with the results once we've compiled them. I need your help getting the word out, because if we don't gather enough data we won't be able to do the study the way we want to. </p></blockquote><p>Please take a few minutes to complete this important survey.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2008/01/shopping-around/">Shopping around: organics on a budget</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Betty from our <a href="../../greengroups/index/">GreenGroup</a> is like many of us. She wants to buy organic as much as possible, but the prices can sometimes make it cost prohibitive. Here's her experience:</p><blockquote><p>H/R:&nbsp; In 2008, I want to purchase more organic foods, so I found the following article -- <a href="http://sagemommy.com/organiconabudget.html">Organics on a Budget</a> -- written by a green mom interesting.&nbsp; It made me think about why I have never made it a regular practice to purchase organic foods more consistently in the first place.&nbsp; The first things that usually come to mind are higher prices and having a more difficult time finding organics in the places that I normally shop.&nbsp; I have no idea whether these statements are factually true or not, but because I believed them to true, I hadn't made any effort to disprove them. </p>
<p>When I lived in San Francisco, I thought organic foods were priced much more expensively in comparison to their non-organic counterparts.&nbsp; On my way home from work, I often passed by a small organic store.&nbsp; I never thought to go into it though because of the price issue.&nbsp; Then, over the years, I one day found myself in the store because I was desperately needing an item (probably milk), and decided that it was much easier for me to walk here and get a carton and save lots of time in the process.&nbsp; Even though I might have to pay more for it, I was willing to make the trade-off.&nbsp; Well, much to my pleasant surprise, I remember the milk costing a little bit less than the supermarket that was a 10 minute walk away!&nbsp; So, after this positive experience, I found myself walking to this store more often to get my milk on the way home from work.&nbsp; Then, one thing led to another, and I started buying fruits and vegies there.&nbsp; Over a period of time, as the store began to have more regular shoppers, it seemed to me that the prices slowly started to come down so that they were more comparable to the prices set at chain stores for the same items.</p>
<p>Have you noticed a price decrease in organic products in the time that you have been shopping for organic products?</p></blockquote><p>It would seem that if more people are buying organics, then the prices might come down as organics becomes more the norm. On the flipside, I think I've read that because demand for organics is growing so quickly, the prices may go up to meet demand. I do think there's a lot of value in shopping around. Market of Choice seems to regularly have much lower prices on organic milk than Fred Meyer does (two of my regular shopping haunts). </p>
<p>Do you shop around? What have your experiences with organic food prices been? </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Saw this little blurbette in the paper the other day how the city of <a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2007/11/akron_to_use_beet_juice_in_roa.html">Akron, Ohio plans to mix some beet juice into its road de-icer this year</a>. Turns out the beet juice, when mixed with rock salt brine and calcium chloride, can keep ice from forming on streets at very low temps. And the beet mix sticks to streets better than traditional treatments, and lessens the corrosive effect on cars. Only downside is it's costly -- about $2.60/gallon (vs. $.90/gallon for calcium chloride). </p>
<p>Might have to try a little experiment. I think I may just have a few CSA beets left in my root cellar.... I'll bet it looks awfully &quot;pretty in pink&quot; too!!</p>
<p>Do you know of any other neat tricks Mother Nature has up her sleeve? Oh and while I'm thinking about Mother Nature... My 3-year-old told me the other day: &quot;We send music up to the sky so that mama nature can be happy...&quot; Awwwww!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We posted about <a href="../../2007/10/are-you-game-fo/">Green Halloween</a> last month -- and &quot;thinking outside the candy box&quot; -- but came home with a great big heapin' pile of candy anyway. Now that my 3-year-old is asking for a treat after every meal, including breakfast, I'm ready for that sugary booty to go away. Some of our readers had some great ideas on how to recycle and reuse the candy, so I thought I'd list those ideas here:</p>
<ul><li>Put chocolates in the freezer to save for later (frozen chocolate will keep longer and may slow them down when trying to eat it -- in the hope that they actually might eat less!)</li>
<li>Use chocolate bars for chocolate chip cookies at a later date (just crunch up the candy before baking)</li>
<li>Save the stuff your kids won't eat (for example, Smartees, gumdrops, Nerds) to decorate holiday cookies or gingerbread houses</li>
<li>Take some of the smaller pieces and donate to someone looking to fill a pinata</li></ul>
<p>Does anyone have any other ideas they'd like to add to the list? And, did you get things besides candy while you and kids were out making the trick-or-treat rounds this year? Sadly, we did not...</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>OK. So I took the advice of several readers and <a href="../../2007/10/hang-on-little-/">hung my tomato vines in the garage to ripen them</a>. (It's gotten a bit too chilly here at night for them to keep growing in the garden and not split/rot). So I hung them in the garage. Yes, it's a miracle. They do ripen. My girls thought ol' mom and dad had really lost it when they saw us hanging plant vines from the broom rack. But here's the surprise of the deal: the vines are decomposing slowly but surely leaving my garage smelling like... wet dog. Is that not one of the worst smells in the world? So we picked as many little tomatoes as we could, and chucked the vines into the compost heap over the weekend. Sadly, the stench of eau de wet dog still lingers in the garage. I know you green moms would not recommend I spritz my garage with Oust. So how do I get rid of that nasty, stinky stench? </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/11/first-time-csa-/">First time CSA season in review: the good, the bad and the beets</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>As most of you know, this year Heather and I split a community-supported agriculture (CSA) share from <a href="/">Gathering Together Farm</a> for the first time. In many ways, this share shaped our summer and the harvest season. Each and every Sunday since last June, we've been coordinating schedules to meet at the <a href="http://www.hillsdalefarmersmarket.com/">Hillsdale Farmers Market</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="../../2007/06/communitysuppor/">first box was overwhelming</a>. Heather was on vacation for that one, so I was on my own. I had no idea how big 10-gallons of produce would really be, and I was pretty clueless as to what some of the things were, and what to do with them. Our readers came to the rescue. Hours after I got home, I remembered that the box came with a newsletter. When I read it, I found there was an itemized list, which helped me identify some of the mystery veggies (pea tops?). And we certainly got to try a few new things, including roasted turnips (coated in a bit of olive oil) and tossed with Parmesan cheese. Who'd have guessed a turnip would taste so good? Prior to this box, turnips seemed like something you might only eat in a famine...</p>
<p>Then there was the discovery of the <a href="../../2007/07/found-it-a-sour/">best. chicken. ever</a>. Maybe we could have found this chicken if we weren't going to the Farmers Market every Sunday. Maybe not. Being in the CSA, we had to go to the market every week -- rain or shine -- and that turned out to be a great thing. Every week, we ran into friends and met new and interesting people. We learned things. We tried samples. We connected with our community. Full circle learning moment about how Farmers Markets build community in a way that shopping at a mega-super-grocery store does not (Bill McKibben talked about this at Powells earlier in the year: how we shop at the grocery store in a zombie-like state pushing our carts, avoiding eye-contact with other people, and pretty much buying the same old-same old stuff every week). So yes, the Farmers Market visits impacted the connectedness of our lives. It also helped me to just try things. Prior to this harvest season, I'd go to the Farmers Market, look at all the produce, then not really buy anything. It took me a while to get comfortable there and figure out that the <a href="../../2007/10/working-wonders/">prices of fresh, locally grown food was worth it</a>. </p>
<p>There were highs like my produce-phobe child telling me <a href="../../2007/06/the_worth_of_a_/">she loved carrots</a> and wanted to <a href="../../2007/08/csa-delivers-th/">try watermelon for the first time</a> since infancy; and very rewarding preserving sessions of <a href="../../2007/10/preserving-peac/">peaches</a> and <a href="../../2007/10/making-apple-bu/">apples</a>. There were lows, like Heather being overwhelmed with potatoes and onions, which then led to finding a way to create a <a href="../../2007/10/rooting-it-out/">modern-day root cellar</a>. Another low was sometimes feeling overwhelmed with veggies, and then, horror of horrors, letting some go to waste and having to pitch them into the compost before being able to eat them. </p>
<p>Then there were the beets. Beets were a gag-fest for me as a kid. Nothing would convince me to try one. I think Heather had some veggies she felt the same about. But then, that was the beauty of sharing. We got to foist some things off on each other, but we also got to exchange recipes and elevate one another to a higher level of culinary accomplishment. </p>
<p>The way the CSA worked is we &quot;invested&quot; in the farm in the spring, and picked our box size (full). We paid up front, and designated which market we'd pick our box up at. If you broke it down by week, it was about $20 per week (or $10 per family). But given what Farmers Market prices are usually like, being in the CSA, we went home with far more than you could buy with $10 or $20 worth on any given market day. </p>
<p>So will we do it again? I'd really like to. Heather -- she'll have to tell you herself. It's funny since this was Heather's idea, and I just &quot;went along&quot; at first. But believe you me, I'm a convert now. I think we ate better this summer than we ever have. And the CSA is to thank for it. It's changed my relationship to food.</p>

I was amazed and delighted, and while the favor was no inconvenience for me, I realize that it gave her relief during a stressful period. </p>
<p>But the soup! It was delicious (you can see I took this photo after I had a bowl) and such a treat to not have to think about what to make for lunch, since I'm still congested and not feeling quite up to speed yet. And there's plenty left for dinner. I love that she used a glass mason jar, which now I can reuse. Mason jars are pretty inexpensive (about a buck, buck-fifty for the quart and half-gallons) and can be reused over and over again (if you use them for canning, you just need to replace the sealed lids). I am definitely going to remember this the next time I prepare a meal for someone -- or even just as an unexpected thank you. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I'm long overdue to update on a few past posts, so will do so today:</p>
<ul><li>I finally got around to conducting the <a href="../../2007/10/testing-enviro-/">&quot;de-stink Pinky&quot; test</a>. I spritzed Pinky with a half/half mix of vinegar/water and <a href="http://www.ph12-6.com/">PH12.6</a>. PH12.6 worked instantly and left no residual smell. The vinegar water worked but left a residual smell for a while, but then dissipated. This is also one instance where procrastination worked in my favor as untreated areas seem to have lost the campfire smell just from airing out over time. </li>
<li>I <a href="../../2007/10/spreadable-butt/">made the soft butter</a> using a hand-mixer instead of a stand-mixer with no problems and thumbs up from the family. I am not a kitchen whiz, but this was very easy, and no one seems to note any difference in taste from the store-bought in-a-throwaway-plastic-container version. Yay! There's one less plastic item I need to recycle!</li>
<li>This whole thing about <a href="../../2007/10/time-for-a-litt/">reuse of &quot;disposable&quot; baby wipes</a> is beyond cool. Sometimes when I write a post, I'm mostly just trying to be funny and then end up learning something amazing like this. I don't use a lot of baby wipes, but still have enough around, and am thrilled to be tossing them into the hamper for a wash now instead of in the trash. I even made sure during a family discussion last night that everyone understood I was throwing these in the hamper with a purpose, and for them not to think ol' mom has really lost it and is throwing garbage in the hamper.</li>
<li>Cheap-o-Dad continues to ride his bike to work. His new goal is to not gas-up again until Thanksgiving. I am trying not to freak about the horrific recent spate of bike v. truck fatalities in Portland. If there's any good in it, it's that some real discussion has been going on regarding making the roads safer for bike riders.</li>
<li>OPB will feature a special on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/bees/">The Silence of the Bees</a> this Sunday on Nature from 8-9pm. Looks very interesting and worth viewing or taping. Did you know honeybees are responsible for every third bite we eat?</li></ul>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Heather often teases me for being the Cliff Claven-type. Always wanting to chime in with trivial bits of info that I've just come across and am dying to share...</p>
<p>So in that vein... The origin of the jack-o-lantern. Does anyone know? Really, now. Why would anyone in their right mind want to carve a face into a squash rendering it inedible? It just seems so wasteful. And especially with mean or scary looking faces. Then to try and burn the house down by sticking a candle inside. So this is what got me to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=origin+of+the+jack+o+lantern&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">Google-ing &quot;origin of the jack o lantern.&quot;</a> And, thank you Google, the 84,000 links you provided will give me sufficient blog fodder for today. Well, the <a href="http://njnj.essortment.com/jackolantern_reuu.htm">story of the jack-o-lantern is a little too wordy and weird for me</a>, and apparently we have the Irish to thank for it. I was hoping to find a cute little jaunty tale I could share with my children, but given the references to the devil, heaven and hell - I think I'll keep all this Cliff Claven Halloween trivia to myself for a few more years. But I will note that the first jack-o-lanterns were carved out of turnips and potatoes. So Heather could probably share a few <a href="../../2007/10/rooting-it-out/">potatoes</a> with you if you haven't gotten your pumpkins yet... </p>
<p>So let's turn our attention to organic, locally grown pumpkins. And other fun and yummy goings-on:</p>
<ul><li>The Great Pumpkin Event -- Saturday, October 27, 8:30am to 2pm, <a href="http://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/">Portland Farmers Market</a> in the South Park Blocks -- will feature a pumpkin carving contest, samples, and a kids' costume parade.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hillsdalefarmersmarket.com/">Hillsdale Farmers Market</a> -- Sunday, October 28, 10am to 2pm, pumpkin decorating tips.</li>
<li>Fall Forest Festival -- Saturday and Sunday, October 27-28, <a href="http://www.tillamookforestcenter.org/">Tillamook Forest Center</a>, 10am to 4pm -- Vote for the best pumpkin, make a Halloween craft or bat house, and storytelling about spooky forest creatures.</li></ul>

Every Sunday I get a few more in my CSA bin, and while I try to foist them off on Renee, she's putting up a good fight. Hence, a gaggle of onions mock me on the counter. The potatoes sprout ears. I like to cook with these foods (and the kids love potatoes), but I just can't keep up. (It's like the Sorcerer's Apprentice...everytime I chop up one onion it multiplies into 20.) What is the best way to preserve these precious root veggies? A root cellar? And what does that involve? Could a kitchen drawer suffice?</p>
<p>Better yet, can you suggest a kid-approved recipe that involves lots and lots of onions and potatoes?</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/10/working-wonders/">Working wonders with a little bit of acreage</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Having recently re-read <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0804115761"><em>A Thousand Acres</em></a>, by Jane Smiley, I was struck by how hard it is to be a farmer: the impossibly long days of physical labor, the whims of weather, the variable prices for harvest yields, the struggle to decide whether to farm organically or to go with the mainstream approach with chemical pesticides, fertilizers and the &quot;bigger is better&quot; mentality.</p>
<p>So it was with delight that I read two features about local families farming organically in the Oregonian this past week: </p>
<ul><li><a href="http://olive-3.live.advance.net/foodday/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/1191614109210660.xml&amp;coll=7">The Zaerpoors of Kookoolan Farms</a>, who are raising organic chickens and eggs in Yamhill. </li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/living/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/1191441306228900.xml&amp;coll=7">Pond family's organic berry farm</a> near the Santiam River.</li></ul>
<p>Both families are heroes in that they are bucking trends. They are younger than the average farmer, working on a smaller scale, and of course going it organic. They acknowledge the gamble of what they are doing. Throwing all their assets into the farm, and well as their time and energies. Kookoolan Farms sells their eggs, chickens and other products at the Hillsdale Farmers' Market, so we've met them, bought their products and have <a href="../../2007/07/pasture-fed-chi/">written glowingly about Kookoolan here before</a>. The Ponds have yet to bring their berries to market. But I have high hopes for them. </p>
<p>I'm sure you sometimes wander the grocery store aisles, and buy things thinking that it's a good, low price. And then you wander the rows of the farmers' market, and again, look for the best prices. And wonder to yourself if it's worth that much... Well, it is. The farmers work hard and deserve our money. When we shop at grocery stores, the farmers are only getting pennies of each dollar we spend. At the farmers' markets, they get it all. And they deserve it! OK. Done preaching to the choir now. </p>

(Kind of like the book <em><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780140501698-0">Blueberries for Sal</a></em> when Sal's mom tells her that they have to pick blueberries and can them so that they will have food for the winter. As if they will starve if they don't pick blueberries. Love that book!) Well, <em>that</em> didn't happen. Determined to freeze <em>something</em> sweet and fresh, I bought two boxes of local peaches at the Hillsdale Farmers Market last Sunday. Visions of peach cobbler and morning oatmeal flecked with peaches spurred me on.</p>
<p>I pulled out my book <em><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/61-9780882666501-0">Keeping the Harvest</a>,</em> which I've had for 10 years and is in like-new condition (if that gives you any idea about my harvest-keeping history). I remember my mom freezing peaches back home in Indiana. She'd place them in a pie pan already mixed up with all of the spices needed for peach pie, and pop it into the freezer. That way when it was time to make pie, she could just pop out the peach mold and stick it in the crust for baking. I decided just to go with freezer bags. The book recommends using an antioxidant, like ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to keep the peaches from browning. You can buy this at the store in crystalline form, but I went the thrifty route and made my own, crushing up three 500 mg vitamin C tablets in 8 cups of water (a recipe provided in the book).</p>
<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/05/freezerpeaches.jpg"><img title="Freezerpeaches" height="187" alt="Freezerpeaches" src="../../images/2007/10/05/freezerpeaches.jpg" width="250" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> Basically I just peeled the peaches (they were at the perfect point of ripeness), sliced them, poured a little vitamin C juice over them, put them in quart-size freezer bags and popped them in the freezer. It seemed so easy that I'm afraid I did something wrong. I could have added sugar or honey, but I was going for purity. I love opening the freezer door now and seeing these bags of golden goodness waiting for oatmeal season. It makes so much sense to preserve local foods if you have the space. I think I'm ready to tackle canning next. Next year, that is.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/10/spreadable-butt/">Spreadable butter without the plastic container</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I duly gathered up all my &quot;hard-to-recycle&quot; plastics and took them to the Westside <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/plastic-recycling.php">Master Recycler Plastics Roundup</a> today. One of the things I noticed we had a lot of were those plastic butter containers. Not the tubs, per se, but the ones that spreadable butter come in (made by Challenge or Land-o-Lakes with a little bit of added canola oil to soften it up). Just came across a <a href="http://www.susiej.com/index.php/how-to-make-butter-healthier-and-spreadable/">recipe thanks to SusieJ that spells out how to make my own spreadable butter</a>. </p>
<p>Without further ado, here is the recipe for spreadable butter:</p><blockquote><p>One stick (8 oz) of real butter
(softened)<br/>1/2 cup grapeseed, canola or mild extra-virgin olive oil<br/>3/4
teaspoon of kosher salt </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Mix until completely creamy (in a food processor). Transfer to a container, cover and refrigerate.&nbsp; It keeps for several weeks. </p></blockquote><p>I do not have a food processor. I do have a KitchenAid stand mixer. I think I'll try that, and will let you know how it goes. And I just bought about 8 sticks of butter, so I am really ready to try this!!</p>
<p>Another option is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Andersons-Authentic-French-Butter/dp/B000JLJ25E">French butter keeper</a>. They claim it needs no refrigeration, stays soft and doesn't spoil when kept in this dish at room temp. Either way, you avoid the dreaded hard-to-recycle plastic butter containers! </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/09/cabbage-the-wea/">Cabbage: the weaning mom's best friend</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>So here's one of those weird stream-of-consciousness things. When Heather and I picked up our CSA goodies at the Farmer's Market on Sunday, one of our items was a big head of cabbage. I happen to love cabbage: in salads, coleslaw (especially with an Asian-rice vinegar flair), you name it. The cabbage also reminded me of breastfeeding, specifically weaning. </p>
<p>I was a serious breastfeeding mom. I vowed that my kids would drink no formula. I vowed to nurse my kids for not one year, but two. And I did. With my first, my supply dwindled after a certain point. Not sure when exactly, but I had long suspected that milk was no longer being produced in great quantity, and that I was merely the human pacifier. When I weaned her at two years, I had no engorgement. So, I had been right about that. </p>
<p>With my second, things were a little different. I was still feeling &quot;let-downs&quot; two years into it. But I was so ready to be done. Two years, people. Four total, if you count cumulatively with both my kids. That's a long time to limit yourself to one drink a night. A long time to be caffeine free. I was READY. So the day came to cut her off, and lo-and-behold, after missing that first feeding, I was engorged like nobody's business. Just like when the milk first comes in right after they release you from the hospital and you're on your own with no nurses to help you through the pain and horror of seeing your breasts turn into these rock-hard milk-filled footballs. With the added pressure of going camping the following weekend, and there was no way in h-e-double-toothpicks that I was going to bring a breastpump out into the wilderness. Wondering where I'm going with this? I'm coming back to that cabbage. </p>
<p>I had <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/baby/bbreastfeed/0,,3x57,00.html">read about cabbage leaves being a comfort and aid in engorgement and weaning</a>. I had grave doubts, certain this was some crazy old wives' tale. It felt like I was setting myself up for some kind of weird practical joke, only I was doing it to myself! Well, I rushed to the produce section in search of cabbage. And let me tell you, having my &quot;girls&quot; wrapped in cool, crisp cabbage leaves helped immensely. I felt so much better over the next few days, which mitigated the slight embarrassment of smelling like wilted cabbage for a week. </p>
<p>My youngest is now three, and it seems a lifetime ago that I breastfed then weaned them both. But seeing that wonderful cabbage this weekend gave me a flashback to those weaning days. Give that a mental bookmark if you will be weaning sometime in the future. Cabbage will be your best friend in case of engorgement, I promise.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I started out the summer as a <a href="../../2007/05/on_becoming_a_r/">reluctant farmer</a>, then was elated to share that <a href="../../2007/06/holy-guacamole-/">we had grown snow peas</a>. The summer season of growing has been eye-opening for our family. We've all shared in the joy of watering, picking and eating ripe fruits and veggies. All told, we grew and nurtured: sunflowers, strawberries, blueberries, snow peas, basil, green beans and tomatoes. Boy, I fretted over my green beans. They just kept growing and growing, with nary a flower. Apparently, my beans were of the &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; variety. They climbed to the sky. They wrapped themselves up and down my bean poles. They climbed up the water meter, the sunflowers and the nearby rose bushes. Then one day, lo and behold, flowers were everywhere. My 3-year-old and I just picked a big bag full of green beans yesterday. We've going to cook them for dinner tonight. It's been exciting and rewarding to grow our own food. It's really taught my kids about the seasons, and what the sun and water does for plants. </p>
<p>It's also been eye-opening to realize there's many ways to grow a garden. I had an old-fashioned notion of rows of plants, in a rectangular plot. And that was the only way to do vegetables. Or, that if you were going to have an ornamental garden with annuals aplenty, then that was that. You limit yourself to flowering ornamentals. I went through a phase where I feared that we didn't have enough natives in my yard (how could I be a self-respecting EnviroMom with so few native plants??). Now that we've reaped what we've sown, we've learned there are no wrong ways to garden. And that natives, annuals and food-bearing plants can all co-habitate nicely, without being restricted to orderly rows, and that's it's beneficial to have pretty flowers bringing the bees and butterflies. It all has a purpose.</p>
<p>What did you learn from your garden this summer? </p>

				<p><a href="http://www.lifewithoutplastic.com/cart/storagecont.htm"></a>I've been putting a bit of thought into my kids' lunches and how I might send them off to school with something healthy, tasty and non-toxic. Luckily, there are lots of options out there:</p>
<p>There's a whole bunch of stainless food containers out there in a range of prices. At Target you can pick up a <a href="http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/sr=1-1/qid=1187991918/ref=sr_1_1/602-1381019-9226252?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B000O3GCFU">10-oz Thermos Food Jar</a> ($17.99) or a <a href="http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/sr=1-1/qid=1187991842/ref=sr_1_1/602-1381019-9226252?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B0002TRRK0">10-oz Nissan Food Jar</a> ($19.99) for warm soup lunches. <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=260,height=260,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/targetthermos_2.jpg"></a><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=260,height=260,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/targetthermos_4.jpg"></a><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=260,height=260,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/targetthermos_5.jpg"><img title="Targetthermos_5" height="225" alt="Targetthermos_5" src="../../images/2007/08/24/targetthermos_5.jpg" width="225" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=260,height=260,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/targetnissan_5.jpg"><img title="Targetnissan_5" height="225" alt="Targetnissan_5" src="../../images/2007/08/24/targetnissan_5.jpg" width="225" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=260,height=260,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/targetnissan_4.jpg"></a><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=260,height=260,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/targetnissan_2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Small stainless food containers are nice for chopped veggies (yeah, right), pasta and other finger foods. <a href="http://www.pearlriver.com/v2/FramesCat.asp?iGroup=333">Pearl River</a> has several options, including these round and rectangular containers. The round ones range in size from 4.75 to 6.25 inches and price from $3 to $4. The rectangular ones are 5.5 and 6.25 inches and $3.50 to 4.50. The prices are great, but I don't know if they are leak-proof (which isn't always an issue). <a href="http://www.lifewithoutplastic.com/cart/storagecont.htm">Life Without Plastic</a> also offers similar round containers in various sizes, though each one comes with a little interior container to separate foods. Pricier at $9.45 to $46.25.<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/pearlriverstainless_2.jpg"></a> <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/pearlriverstainless_3.jpg"></a><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/pearlriverstainless_4.jpg"><img title="Pearlriverstainless_4" height="168" alt="Pearlriverstainless_4" src="../../images/2007/08/24/pearlriverstainless_4.jpg" width="225" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/pearlriverrectangle_3.jpg"><img title="Pearlriverrectangle_3" height="168" alt="Pearlriverrectangle_3" src="../../images/2007/08/24/pearlriverrectangle_3.jpg" width="225" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/pearlriverrectangle_2.jpg"></a><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/pearlriverrectangle.jpg"></a></p>

<p>For wrapping up sandwiches, <a href="http://www.pristineplanet.com/details.asp?id=2124">Natural Waxed Paper Bags</a> are nice and cheap, but not really reusable. There's the <a href="http://www.wrap-n-mat.com/index.php">Wrap-N-Mat fabric sandwich wrap</a> for $6.50, though I've read that one mom didn't like the <a href="http://veganlunchbox.blogspot.com/2007/04/pul-wrap.html">plastic smell</a> coming from the liner (ew).</p>
<p>Finally there's the lunch box. <a href="http://www.reusablebags.com/">Reusable Bags</a> has a gazillion lead-free lunch boxes and bags in a range of sizes and prices. This <a href="http://www.reusablebags.com/store/mimi-sardine-medium-modern-cloth-lunch-flower-power-p-561.html">Mimi the Sardine bag</a> is pretty darn cute ($19.95). <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=250,height=250,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/24/mimisardinelunchbag.jpg"><img title="Mimisardinelunchbag" height="200" alt="Mimisardinelunchbag" src="../../images/2007/08/24/mimisardinelunchbag.jpg" width="200" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> I think it's hard to buy a lunch bag online -- you don't want it too small or too large. Might have to scout around town for something. </p>
<p>And don't forget the <a href="../../2007/08/crafting-cloth-/">cloth napkin</a> and packing <a href="../../2007/08/greening-it-up-/">your own silverware</a>! Yikes. This is starting to sound like a lot of work. Well, there's lots of options and bunches more that I simply don't have the time or energy to research. Any others you like? Any good local Portland stores to scout out for reusable lunch box items?&nbsp; </p>

While I've never managed to read Proust's epic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time"><em>Remembrance of Things Past</em></a>, I've managed to hear about the memories evoked from eating the madeleine cakes more times than I can count. Now I've just had a similar experience. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Heather and I met at the farmer's market to pick up and split our <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a> CSA box as we've done pretty much every weekend for the past three months. I'd accidentally left my wallet at home, so was unable to buy extra melons, bread and tomatoes as I'd hoped. Heather had no cash to lend, but did graciously let me take the watermelon that was part of our box. </p>
<p>Having promised my cantaloupe-loving 3-year-old some melon, we cut open the watermelon for dinner. It was glorious. Surprisingly, it was not pink, but yellow. And unlike most watermelons you buy from stores, it had delectable flavor, extreme juiciness, a sweet perfume and loads of black seeds. Eating that watermelon brought me back a good 30 years or so (how did I get this old?). We were talking about how when we were little, watermelon only came once a year. And we'd sit out in the yard, getting all drippy and sticky, and we'd spit the seeds (our parents allowing us to do this, even encouraging us sometimes!). Or we'd tease the little ones saying if they ate the seeds that watermelons would grow in their tummies. It's hard to believe I'd forgotten all that stuff. And harder still to
believe that all this time has passed since I'd eaten a watermelon
tasty enough to evoke it. My kids also marveled at how it was yellow, and that so often the varieties that get sold in stores are selected because they travel well, have been bred to be seedless, or fit a picture of what something is supposed to look like. But taste like crap. Or worse yet, like nothing. That describes most of the melons I've eaten over the past several years (not counting the locally and organically grown ones we've had this year). </p>
<p>One luscious watermelon. Eating all this locally grown produce has helped me realize what summer is all about.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My mom, who lives in Hawaii, is called &quot;Tutu&quot; by my kids (which means &quot;Grandma&quot; in Hawaiian). She just flew back to her island paradise this morning after a wonderful stay with us. As you probably know from reading EnviroMom, much of this green living stuff is new to Heather and I. So a lot of our new &quot;funny ways&quot; -- such as <a href="../../2007/06/cheap-o-dad-fun/">greywater reuse</a>, getting our <a href="../../2007/06/communitysuppor/">produce through a CSA</a>, and our REI method (<strong>R</strong>ecycle <strong>E</strong>very <strong>I</strong>tem) due to our <a href="../../2007/03/victory_downsiz/">minimalist garbage service</a> pickup -- were new to my mom. I have to applaud her. She was a trooper. Last night as we were boiling pasta for dinner she asked if I wanted to use the boiled water for killing weeds on the patio. She just got with the program. Very cool. Not going to make the comparison to old dogs learning new tricks. </p>
<p>One of the really cool things my mom did on this visit was arrive with a suitcase full of goodies for the girls. Swimsuits, books, puzzles, dresses. Does this scenario sound familiar when the grands come to your house too? What really rocked was that she got all their goodies from garage sales. I love that it was all second-hand/reused goods. It was still all new to my kids. </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/07/weekend-getaway/">Weekend getaway EnviroMom style</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My mom has been visiting, and very generously offered to watch the kids for a weekend so my husband and I (the self-appointed Cheap-o-Dad) could celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary. So last weekend was our big trip away. Despite seeking advice from <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/02/weekend_getaway.html">ReadySetMom readers on good weekend getaway locales</a>, we ended up not going very far at all. About 12 miles down the road. We drove from Portland to Newberg, OR, which is the starting place of the annual <a href="http://www.vineride.com/">Vineride</a>. Pre-kids, we did a lot of biking. In fabulous far-away places like Tuscany, the south of France, the Netherlands. In the six years since kids, we've probably logged about 12 miles total on our bikes (not counting <a href="../../2007/07/cheap-o-dad-one/">Cheap-o-Dad's recent bike-to-work commutes</a>). The Vineride organizers very generously leave their maps up on their site. We choose the <a href="http://www.vineride.com/bicycle_course.shtm">35-mile option</a>. Of course, we weren't riding on &quot;ride day,&quot; so it was unsupported and we printed our own Google maps. But it was just gorgeous. We saw lush orchards, vineyards, tree farms, farmland, chickens, and one overly zealous guard dog (who warned us that we really shouldn't be biking on his gravel road in city-slick tires). The sun was shining. The humidity was low. We biked past an old-fashioned swimming hole -- something you never would have seen from a car. We lunched at the fabulous French-inspired <a href="http://www.cuveedining.com/">Cuvee</a> in Carlton (on Bastille Day, no less), and met a very nice couple from Boise who seemed to enjoy bike travel as much as we do.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it ended up being 42+ miles (factoring in one wrong turn and one detour). Killer noodle legs at the end of the day, and I nearly told off a cow (yes, as in bovine) to mind her own beeswax as I huffed up the last painful hill into Newberg on granny gear. My point (if there is one) is that like <a href="../../2007/07/a-big-box-o-roc/">Heather wrote since reading <em>Last Child in the Woods</em></a>, there really is a world of wonder just in our own backyard. And if you venture a little further, like, say 12 miles, it's kind of like being in Tuscany (but with lots more pickup trucks and far too many big gulp cups discarded by the side of the road). We never actually made it to any wineries. They all seemed to be atop large hills. But it was lovely. To get a taste of non-city life in a way that I don't on a daily basis. Can't recommend it highly enough. And since we didn't drive very far, Cheap-o-Dad is still on track to not fill up his gas tank all summer! </p>

				<p>OK, how's that for an overly sensational, ripped from the headlines kind of title? Pretty good. If I do say so myself.</p>
<p>But back to reality. There was a little tiny article in our paper today that jumped out at me: &quot;China has closed 180 food factories after inspectors found industrial chemicals being used in products from candy to seafood, state media said today.&quot;</p>
<p>Said chemicals include:</p>
<ul><li>Formaldehyde</li>
<li>Illegal dyes</li>
<li>Industrial wax</li></ul>
<p>Being used to make:</p>
<ul><li>Candy</li>
<li>Pickles</li>
<li>Crackers</li>
<li>Seafood</li></ul>
<p>Yum!! Now let's not forget about the Chinese wheat gluten tainted with melamine that killed all those dogs and cats. And those Thomas trains coated with lead-based paint.</p>
<p>The writing is on the wall, people. Was there ever a better reason to buy local? <a href="http://greenwoman.typepad.com/biggreenpurse/2007/06/stop_buying_toy.html">Diane of The Big Green Purse suggests we stop buying toys made in China</a>. Probably not a bad idea. And, Heather's given us a <a href="../../2007/06/umpqua-bank-off/">great reason to shop locally in the Portland Metro area</a>. Your good health and life may be depending on it!!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Thank you, Carol W, for inspiring me to make <a href="../../2007/06/pledging_loyalt/#comments">strawberry freezer jam</a>. I've made cooked jams in the past. And have loved them, but have avoided it for years now since our lovely children entered our lives. Canning just seemed like way too much time and trouble.</p>
<p>So I was so pleased by your suggestion to make strawberry freezer jam. It was so fast and easy, and everyone in the family loves eating it (even my fruit-o-phobe 5-year old). I now plan to put up a lot of freezer fruit jams this summer, and probably would not have done so otherwise! The fruit-o-phobe even wants to picks blueberries with me when they come into season. All those readings of <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=014050169x"><em>Blueberries for Sal</em></a> seem to have had some impact. Maybe someday she'll even eat one!! Well, at least I feel we're on the right track. I've just started reading <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780060852559">Barbara Kingsolver's <em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</em></a> and am pleased to see even her kids didn't love all fruits and veggies as kids. So there's hope for us too!!</p>

<p>This is how I feel about my garden. I have truly grown a snow pea. Several as a matter of fact. My beans are now taller than I am, every plant I started has grown. I now have sunflowers started from seed, snow peas, green beans, blueberries and strawberries growing in my own yard! </p>

But is Organic Valley milk better than competitor Horizon's organic milk? They are both major sellers in the organic dairy space. When a lot of people think organic, they think small, local farm.

When I think small and local in the dairy domain, <a href="http://www.alpenrose.com/dairy.htm">Alpenrose</a> is the first one that comes to my mind.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Cost of a bunch of carrots from our <a href="http://gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">CSA share</a>: too hard to calculate, but suffice it to say not very much.</p>
<p>Hearing my veggie-phobe child say &quot;Mom, these carrots are delicious, can I have another one please?&quot;: priceless.</p>
<p>Prior to being in the CSA, I shopped for produce like I shopped for most things (I hadn't been aware that I did this prior to hearing <a href="../../2007/04/lets_face_itste/">Bill McKibben speak about this at Powells</a> a few months back). Running the grocery store gauntlet, buying the same things every week, regardless of price, season or growing location. Honestly, I don't think I've bought any other kind of carrot except baby carrots in several years. You know, those <em>conveniently</em> precut, peeled and tumbled carrot nubs. Quite frankly, I don't think my kids realized they didn't grow that way. No wonder the fresh, organic, local carrots taste so much better to them. So, we did a taste test comparison: </p>
<ul><li>Store-bought baby carrot: crunchy, cold, mostly flavorless, and orange-ish/white-ish in appearance.</li>
<li>CSA carrot: sweet, bold carroty taste, crunchy, cold, fresh, delicious and bright orange.</li></ul>
<p>I cannot rave about our CSA enough. Heather and I were comparing notes on the delicious produce we have been eating. No, <em>savoring. </em>Being
in the CSA has rocked my world, in a really good way. We are trying new
foods, sharing recipes, and savoring locally and organically
grown delicacies. And I'm starting to think that &quot;convenient&quot; is a bad word.</p><br/>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Wouldn't it be great if our kids were served more locally-grown foods in the school cafeteria? Well, there are a few things you can do to show your support for the Food and Farm bill. Check out this ACTION ALERT we received from the <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/farmtoschool/">EcoTrust Food & Farms</a> program:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>We need your help today to get Oregon's Farm to School bills passed. </strong>Key decisions will be made this week. Now is the time to call your legislators in Salem. </p>
<p>Oregon is one of a handful of states that doesn't contribute additional funds to support implementation of the National School Lunch and Breakfast program. Now it's catch up time. Let's improve the quality of food we're serving our kids, while simultaneously supporting Oregon farmers. While we're at it, let's fund school gardens and ensure that children across the state learn that carrots grow in the ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In April, the House Education Committee unanimously sent all three Farm to School bills on to the Joint Ways and Means Committee</strong>. <br/>Why wouldn't they? With no opposition, these are &quot;apple pie&quot; bills. But that doesn't mean it's time to break out the ice cream. These bills, great as they are, won't get passed unless we keep the pressure on to find the money to pay for them! </p>
<p><u>Please contact members of the Joint Ways and Means Committee and show your support.</u><br/>The final frontier for these bills is a funding decision that can only be made by the Joint Ways and Means Committee. The Oregon State Legislature will likely wrap up business at the end of June. Let's make sure our elected officials fund the Farm to School bills before breaking for the summer. </p>
<p>There are four key legislators who need to hear from you: </p>
<p>Senator Kurt Schrader – (D) Canby; Ways and Means Co-Chair, 503-986-1720&nbsp; <a title="blocked::mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us" target="_blank">sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Representative Mary Nolan – (D) SW Portland; Ways and Means Co-Chair, 503-986-1436&nbsp; <a title="blocked::mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us" target="_blank">rep.marynolan@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Senator Richard Devlin – (D) Tualatin; Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources Co-Chair, 503-986-1719 <a title="blocked::mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us" target="_blank">sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Representative Brian Clem – (D) Salem; Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources Co-Chair, 503-986-1421 <a title="blocked::mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us" target="_blank">rep.brianclem@state.or.us</a> (Sponsor of HB 3307 and HB 3185) </p>
<p>Key Messages to Legislators:<br/>(1) The bills (HB 3476, HB 3307, HB 3185) create new market opportunities for Oregon farmers and food processors, fund schools to buy Oregon agricultural products, and support school-based learning gardens. </p>
<p>(2) The bills deserve attention from the Joint Ways and Means Committee ASAP. </p>
<p>(3) The Oregon State Legislature should prioritize and pass all three bills. </p>
<p>How to Make Contact:<br/><u>Call the Legislators Listed Above.</u> Use the phone numbers above to make a personal call. Leave a message with the legislator, staff member, or on the answering service stating the key messages listed above (with bill numbers) and how you can be reached. </p>
<p><u>Send an E-mail.</u> Express your support in an e-mail. Be sure your e-mail includes your home or business address. Specify the bill numbers (see above) and reiterate the key messages above. Personalize your e-mail if possible – why are the bills important to you? </p>
<p><u>Forward this Action Alert.</u> Urge others you may know in the critical districts above to call their legislators. </p>
<p><u>Don't Stop at the Four Above.</u> Call your own legislators, too. Even if they don't sit on the Joint Ways and Means Committee, urge them to keep close track of these bills anyway. Need help with contact information? See the links above. </p>
<p><u>Get Creative</u>: Have your seven year old call, send a note from a high school student, ask the legislator you are contacting what they had for lunch! </p>
<p><u>Sign up for Additional Action Alerts</u>: <br/>Visit <a onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://whatcounts.com/t?r=915&amp;c=951523&amp;l=37310&amp;ctl=17BC67E:9E47577DB96EEB3A80B8C8289600E1827DDB2469356655AC" target="_blank">www.ecotrust.org/farmtoschool</a> for more information and to sign up for additional action alerts. </p></blockquote>

				<p>The first time I tasted an Oregon-grown Hood strawberry, I vowed never to eat another Californian strawberry again. The difference was that vast. For those of you who have eaten <a href="http://www.oregon-strawberries.org/sx11/sx11.htm">Hood strawberries</a>, I know you know what I mean. </p>
<p>Today, an <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/editorials/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/1181091488130230.xml&amp;coll=7">Oregonian editorial suggests we, as consumers, should purchase only Oregon strawberries</a>, including processed foods with canned, frozen or preserved berries. It'd cost more, but could help Oregon return as the king in national strawberry production (as we once were 50 years ago). What do you think? </p>
<p>This year's crop ripened earlier than usual, and some of the farms growing strawberries are struggling to find enough pickers. We'd better all do our part and get to some u-pick farms and pick some while they are ripe. What's your favorite u-pick farm for strawberries? Do you eat them all fresh, or do you prefer to preserve these heavenly red berries in jams, by freezing or dehydration?</p>

				<p>My son is the world's pickiest eater. He seldom eats dinner.

He's a tough one. And very skinny. A neighbor mentioned that her son likes <a href="http://www.lightlife.com/smartdogs.html">Smart Dogs</a>, which are vegan and made from veggie protein (soy -- no GMOs). I was immediately suspicious. </p>
<p>But I bought some. Smart Dogs look like a hot dog. They sort of taste like a hot dog. So I presented them to my kids, and my son ate two of them and asked for more. My daughter wouldn't touch it; she's had too many real hot dogs to be fooled by an imposter. My husband recoiled in horror. And I thought they were kind of gross. But if my skinny boy will eat it, it's good, right? Each dog contains 8 grams of protein -- can't complain about that. I won't be serving them every day, but it's nice to know there's something the kid will eat that is semi-healthy. They are semi-healthy, right?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Despite having looked forward to the start of our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture">CSA</a> for months, the night before our first box arrived I had a scary dream. You know that movie <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/fant2.html"><em>Fantasia</em> and that sequence of the Sorcerer's Apprentice</a>? It was like that, only with fresh produce. I'd arrive at the <a href="/">Hillsdale Farmers Market</a> to pick up our box of fruits and veggies, only to have more and more fruits and vegetables piling higher and higher, until my re-usable cloth bags were exploding and I was staggering out of the market under a giant pile of delicious, organic, locally grown produce. Not exactly the stuff of true nightmares, but it caused me a bit of anxiety. Heather and I are sharing our box, so my anxiety was compounded knowing that my family would be responsible for consuming all of this fiber-filled goodness on our own (note that my two kids aren't big produce consumers). </p>
<p>As it turned out, I think we'll be able to rally this first week. We made a fabulous salad for dinner last night with mixed greens, carrots, pea tops and strawberries. Here's what was in the first &quot;box of plenty&quot; grown for us by <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a>: </p>
<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/04/csa1_2.jpg"><img width="250" height="187" border="0" src="../../images/2007/06/04/csa1_2.jpg" title="Csa1_2" alt="Csa1_2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>
</p>
<ul><li>Pea tops
</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Cilantro</li>
<li>Dandelion Greens</li>
<li>Rhubarb</li>
<li>Lettuce - 2 heads</li>
<li>Mountain and green spinach</li>
<li>Purple Viking potatoes</li>
<li>White turnips</li>
<li>Strawberries
</li></ul>
<p>I was so glad they included a nice little newsletter to tell us what was there (because I had no idea on the pea tops, dandelion greens and turnips, having not met any of these kind vegetables before). It also had some recipes, which I will try. But I'd be glad for any more of your ideas on what to do with turnips, rhubarb, pea tops and dandelion greens. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I got a good closeup look at what global warming does the other day when we brought little sunflower plants home from preschool that the kids had started from seeds. I left my daughter's plant in the car on a gorgeous sunny day just like today. For a bit too long. I did not think to crack the windows. In a very short time, her two little sunflower seedlings went from perfectly healthy to near-death experience. Over the next few days, I hid the paper cup with the sickly flowers on a window ledge in the kitchen. They died a slow and painful death. Today I pronounced them dead. But sneakily, I'd stuck two new sunflower seeds in and those have now sprouted. So as long as I keep the flower seedlings out of the car, I think we're in pretty good shape with those. You should know that last year I killed her zinnia seedling outright when I accidentally dropped it coming out of the car on the way home. Who would have thought driving plants could be so hazardous to their health?</p>
<p>So it was with a fair amount of reluctance than I accepted free plant starts of peas and beans at the <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/05/hillsdale_farme.html">opening day of the Hillsdale Farmers Market</a>. My daughters love to water plants more than anything else in the world, so they are doing pretty well. I think I managed to find a decent place for them in the garden. But I gotta confess, I'm scared to death. I don't think I've ever grown and eaten <em>anything</em> since the radishes my dad helped me with when I was 5 years old. And come to think of it, I don't think I ever actually ate any of the radishes. </p>
<p>I love the idea of eating locally. It doesn't get much more local than your own yard. But I am scared and feeling way over my head here. Can someone be my farming mentor? Please, please, please? Or just give me some suggestions or words of encouragement? </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My friend Helen and I were chatting today while our kids took swim lessons. Neither of us has pets, so we have only seen and read in the news about <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/business/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/business/1177471544189920.xml&amp;coll=7">pet foods contaminated by melamine</a>, and fortunately our families have not been personally impacted. We do however, have quite a few melamine kid plates and bowls in our possession. It got us to wondering how safe these dishes are to use. We've been talking about the <a href="../../2007/03/baby_step_stop_/">safety/hazards of heating in plastic containers on EnviroMom.com</a> a bit recently. So my best advice was to not heat or serve anything hot on melamine (I think they say not to use them in the microwave). And also to wash in the dishwasher upper rack only, as directed. But for the most part, I've stopped using these kinds of plastics. What about you? Do you use melamine serveware for your kids, or have you cleared your cabinets of this type of plastic? Do you have any words of advice on whether or not to continue to use melamine?</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/04/bottle_bill_get/">Bottle bill gets an update - finally!</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Oregon was a maverick back in 1971 when it started charging a five cent deposit on beer and carbonated soda cans and bottles. Now, 26 years later, the <a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/politics/2007/04/updated_bottle_bill_headed_to.html">legislature today added bottled water</a> and flavored water, like tea, to the Bottle Bill. It won't kick in until January 2009, but we should see an increase in the number of water bottles that are recycled. Only about one-third of water bottles end up getting recycled; the rest are tossed in the trash, or apparently on the beach. There's a woman in my Master Recycler class that works for <a href="http://www.solv.org/">SOLV</a>, and she said that they picked up 54 tons of garbage off the coast a couple of weeks ago -- most of which was plastic water bottles. </p>
<p>I used to pick up one of those big cases of bottled water at Costco every so often. But I've now -- slowly -- managed to change my habits. Instead of buying bottled water, I bought a reusable water bottle, which I'm just now getting in the habit of filling up when I walk out the door. However, I'm thoroughly confused about what is considered &quot;safe.&quot; A couple of eco-sites I like, <a href="http://idealbite.com/tiplibrary/archives/bottled_up/">IdealBite</a> and <a href="http://www.thegreenguide.com/doc/ask/nalgene">TheGreenGuide</a>, say to avoid using plastic altogether because they all leach chemicals, and go with stainless or aluminum instead. I got my water bottle at New Seasons, made of odor-resistant Aleutian plastic, but I can't find any info on that. Guess I'll live on the edge -- I thought I was doing pretty good just using a water bottle!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>One of the things Heather and I got to talking about after her epiphanies of the <a href="../../2007/03/a_funny_thing_h/">local food consiracy day</a>, was the importance of buying fresh food, locally and in season. She told me about a company called <a href="http://www.portlandpreserve.com/">Portland Preserve</a>, that teaches the mostly forgotten art and science of preserving food. As much as I'd like to take a class, I don't think I'll be able to find the time right now. </p>
<p>I've done a fair amount of fruit jams and jellies in the past. But what I'm really fired up to try this year is food dehydration. Ages ago, I borrowed a <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=food+dehydrator&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=m9T&amp;um=1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=froogle&amp;ct=title">food dehydrator</a> from my father in law, back when we lived in California. Now I'm thinking to rent one (is this possible?) or go in on one with a friend or two. Does anyone have recommendations of good products out there? Also, what do you do to keep the food fresh and dry once dehydrated? I know there are those food sealer things that seal it up in vacuum pack plastic bags, but I really don't think I want to go the plastic route if there are better alternatives. </p>
<p>Please let me know if you have info to share on storing and dehydrating food. Thanks in advance for your advice and input!!</p>

				<p>How do I love thee <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/html/">Burgerville</a>? Let me count the ways.<br/>I love thee for thy committment to sustainable food, both local and fresh<br/>I love thee for thy killer turkey burger and cage-free egss.<br/>My heart yearns for thy seasonal treats like strawberry shortcake,<br/>chocolate hazelnut smoothies and Walla Walla onion rings.<br/>My soul is at peace with thy kid's meal prizes:<br/>trowels and seed packets, wind power reuseable stickers, bug coloring books!<br/>My only grief is that sometimes my kids enjoy playing with the balloons<br/>rather than eating their delicious meals, but alas, who cares?<br/>I love thee in too many ways to count! <br/>I shall love thee next time in prose as clearly I am no poet.</p>
<p>(Apologies to the memory and work of <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/literature/elizabethbarrettbrowning/poems/sonnetsfromtheportuguese/howdoilovetheeletmecounttheways.html">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>).</p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Dark-All-American/dp/0060938455">Fast Food Nation</a> a few years back, we started calling all the fast-food burger joints &quot;pooh-pooh burger.&quot; I wanted to make sure my kids understood never to eat there. They remember that nickname; it's catchy. While we don't eat a lot of burgers and fries, Burgerville has sure given us a tasty alternative to pooh-pooh burger. I was thinking about Burgerville while gardening today -- we really enjoy the little trowels and rakes they provided in their kids meals last summer. What practical, fun prizes! </p>
<p>Well, I could go on and on about Burgerville. But I won't. Because that'll make me hungry. And I promise not to foist any lame poetry on you again anytime soon.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>So once again I'm repeating content from the Wall Street Journal, which despite their conservative tendencies, does produce some great journalism. Bear with me. The Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit dedicated to raising concerns about pesticides, has created a <a href="http://www.foodnews.org/">guide</a> to the 12 most contaminated fruits and vegetables and the 12 least. Basically, they encourage consumers to buy organic whenever possible, but some foods do not absorb pesticides as easily as others. So if you have to make a choice between organic versus conventional, these are the foods they recommend:</p>
<p><strong>Buy these organic:</strong> peaches, apples, sweet bell peppers, celery, nectarines, strawberries, cherries, pears, imported grapes, spinach, lettuce, potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>Safest conventionally-grown foods:</strong> onions, avocado, frozen sweet corn, pineapple, mango, asparagus, frozen sweet peas, kiwi fruit, bananas, cabbage, broccoli, papaya. </p>
<p>In addition, they recommend buying organic milk, or at the least milk that doesn't contain the growth hormone rBGH, organic baby food (check out <a href="http://nicecubesbaby.com/">Nice Cubes Frozen Organic Baby Food</a>), and meat that is free of growth hormones and antibiotics. They say it is particularly important for pregnant women and young children to eat organic foods and no-hormone milk whenever possible since pesticides are thought to impact fetal development and growth.</p>
