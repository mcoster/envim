				<p>One of the really cool things about having kids is <em>sometimes</em> they are really interested in what you say, and more than anything, they're watching what you do. If you're like me, and you have kids who ask a lot of questions, I tend to go into &quot;tour guide&quot; mode -- explaining just about every blessed thing I do in anticipation of the millions of questions they will pepper me with. Kinda like a preschool teacher: &quot;So first we rinse the milk jug because the good people who recycle the plastic need it to be clean. As far as the caps go, we can put those aside for the Master Recycler plastics roundup....&quot;</p>
<p>The beauty of this is that they pay attention and parrot my actions and words with other kids, and will sometimes give me friendly reminders when I've forgotten my reuseable grocery bags, or didn't turn out the bathroom light, or left the water running just a hair too long while doing the dishes. I hear them do it with me, my husband, and my father. These little pups help us old dogs learn new tricks. </p>
<p>And then sometimes they come up with really cute things on their own, using the enviro-friendly lingo we banter about. Case in point, my 5-year-old came home from school the other day with a tissue and construction paper crown that she says makes her &quot;Queen of Recycling.&quot; Words I never would have put into the same sentence when I was 5. And I am honored to wear that crown.</p>

				<p>A couple of weeks ago we had a <a href="../../../2007/10/win-a-set-of-fa/">drawing for a set of Fabkins</a>, kid-sized, kid-themed cloth napkins. In order to enter, readers had to give us a <a href="../../../kidtips/index/">KidTip</a>, something they do at their home to foster environmental awareness in their kids through direct activities or parent-modeling. Here's a sampling of some of the great tips we received (with more to come):</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>Tara:</strong> To teach my kids to care about the environment I encourage them to walk whenever possible. Not only are we not polluting by driving the car, we also get to slow down and enjoy nature as we get groceries, complete our errands, or walk to school.</p>
<p><strong>Christy:</strong> Our four and half year old son Simon helps us prepare our recyclable plastics for the Plastics Roundup several times a year by separating all of the containers by number, then putting them into separate paper bags for drop-off. We go together to the Plastics Roundup and he matches the numbers on the bags up with the bins where they are deposited. He gets to be leader for this family project and the look of pride on his face is absolutely priceless.</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> My daughter is only 13 months old, but I think the biggest thing I do to teach her about the environment is to teach her about nature. We go out everyday and look at birds, trees, leaves, bushes, squirrels etc. We've also started an herb and vegetable garden so she will have a connection to where her food comes from. Also, we don't have paper napkins in our house - she loves playing peek-a-boo with our cloth ones - so I know she'd love to have her own!</p>
<p><strong>Brittani:</strong> I am sorta a newbie greenmom but recently I stopped buying those celebrity magazines at the grocery store checkout because I was just sickened when I thought of how wasteful they are (both natural resources and money resources!) and most of the mags are weekly! Think of how much crap goes into making them!&nbsp; Ack!!!&nbsp; So maybe if people stopped buying them they wouldn’t print as many, therefore fewer trees hacked down, fewer chemicals from inks,&nbsp; therefore a happier world all around.&nbsp; Plus, I don’t really want my kids thinking I buy into all of that advertising/celebrity/commercial life stuff.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">We loooove to hear what parents do to foster eco-awareness in their kids.

				<p>Thanks to everyone who submitted a <a href="../../../kidtips/index/">KidTip</a> for the <a href="../../../2007/10/win-a-set-of-fa/">Fabkins contest</a>! We'll be posting some of those in the near future. Congrats to Julie P. who won the set of Fabkins! This is the first time we've done a drawing on EnviroMom (I think) so if you're wondering how we do it: we just print off the EnviroMom Inbox, cut out the names of entrants, fold them, mix 'em up and pick one. Here's Julie's KidTip:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>We use cloth diapers as hankies for our little one instead of using disposable tissues. This is better for his skin and cuts down on waste!</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Good tip! We recently had a good discussion about other types of <a href="../../../2007/10/time-for-a-litt/#comments">non-disposable hankies</a>. I noticed last night as I emptied the trash for our <a href="../../../2007/09/baby-steps-lead/">once-a-month garbage pick-up</a> that our bathroom baskets were full of Kleenex. I do believe it's time for a change. Thanks for playing, everyone! (And thanks to Fabkins!) Hopefully we can do more drawings for eco-friendly products in the future.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My daughter came home from school one day and told me that after they finish eating lunch it's time for <em>recycling</em>. I haven't had lunch with her yet, but I'm guessing that the cafeteria must have a recycling bin for milk cartons. I was impressed that whomever relays these instructions uses the word <em>recycling</em> instead of saying<em> throw away your trash</em>. It seems like such a small thing, but you can change a child's way of thinking about waste by changing your vocabulary to words like <em>composting</em> and <em>recycling</em>. I'm trying to say, &quot;please recycle that  paper,&quot; instead of, &quot;please throw that paper in the recycling bin.&quot; By using <em>recycle</em> as an action verb, you eliminate the whole suggestion of <em>throwing</em> something away. </p>
<p>Renee's suggestion for <a href="../../../2007/04/baby_step_chang/">replacing household trash cans with recycling cans</a> and my recent addition of <a href="../../../2007/09/easy-peasy/">recycling cans in the bathrooms</a> also support this kind of messaging. Children hear the words, they see and participate in the activity of recycling and then they build an awareness of the cycle of waste. Now, hopefully they will start understanding how to avoid it in the first place (a work in progress for us all)!</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2007/10/kidtip-teachabl/">KidTip: Teachable Moments during Potty Training</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val=""/>
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Of course, the goal of potty training is to teach your child to listen to body cues, go to the toilet <em>before</em> he/she needs to go, hoist his/her little bottom onto the toilet seat, make a... ummmm... deposit in the commode, wipe little bottom (front to back, if we're talking about girls), wash hands, then do a happy dance, right? </p>
<p>I waited until my kids were super ready until we started formal potty training, and everything went well. We even read a little propaganda book put out by the makers of Charmin toilet tissue called &quot;Way to Go!&quot; (hey, it was free, and I bleeped out all product-placement references while reading the book, and no, <a href="../../../2007/06/encourage_costc/">we do not buy Charmin</a>). So, getting them to do their business <em>in the potty</em> wasn't too hard for us. And my kids are both girls. Apparently girls are much easier. (Heather posted about the adventure with her son's potty training <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/05/potty_training_.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/07/he-gives-a-whol.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/08/potty-training-.html">here</a> -- in case you're in the mood for a really, really, really good laugh).</p>
<p>But, the point I'm trying to make is that potty training is a teaching time about the amount of toilet tissue they actually need to use for each wipe. This is really important because if you model that they need a big, honkin' wad of paper, then they will use a big, honkin' wad of paper each time. I apparently was taught that more is better during my tender potty training time. My husband, dear Cheap-o-Dad, says I'm like the people on Wheel-of-Fortune when I'm getting TP. Spin that wheel! Big money, big money. In my defense, I've reformed my ways. I now take a much smaller piece of TP. Several squares tops. </p>
<p>With kids, a good rule of thumb is to suggest a length of TP as long as their forearm. Teach them from the get-go not to use too much TP. You'll thank me for it later (since moms seem to be the only human beings capable of changing toilet paper rolls). And if you're lucky, they will heed what you have taught them and wipe with a minimal amount of TP, consistently. My kids have gone to the other end of the spectrum, and rarely wipe at all. Oh well... Is it any wonder moms are always harping on the importance of clean underwear?</p>

My kids have really gotten on board with the idea of durable goods vs. disposable. I am so glad we went ahead and made the cloth, tie-dye napkins. As novice tie-dye artists, it was a lot of fun, not nearly as messy as I feared, and I think they will have real pride of ownership (and hopefully will hang onto) these lunch-box napkins. The trickiest part was getting their tiny fingers into the rubber gloves. I also mixed the dye in small batches using big yogurt tubs (since we weren't making large pieces, such as t-shirts). </p>

				<p>I don't know where this crazy idea came from. I can't get it out of my head. I'm thinking about a batik/tie-dye project making cloth napkins for my kindergarten-bound daughters lunches. With my 5-year-old's help. Is this utterly insane? I'm all for durable goods. I bought some stainless steel utensils to pack in her lunch from Ikea. Hopefully we'll use them for years. Now this thing with the napkins is either brilliant or insane. You tell me.</p>
<p>Here's my idea: try to write her name on the napkins with the batik wax, then tie-die or batik the fabric so that they'll be vibrantly colored and fun to use. And with her name on them, they won't get lost. The wacky part of this equation is I'm not a crafty person. You should have seen the birthday cake I made for my 3-year-old's family party a few weeks ago. I had visions of a gorgeous, delectable cake a la <a href="http://www.bakerandspicebakery.com/">Baker & Spice</a>. It was more like a hockey puck with sprinkles. Heather and I nearly wet ourselves laughing when I first showed it to her. </p>
<p>What in the world these napkins are going to turn out like is beyond me. Probably quite ugly. To top it off, I was thinking I'd use all natural type dyes. Maybe something brewed from wildflowers. Am I stark raving mad? Please, someone who is a competent crafter, set me straight before I mention this hare-brained idea to my daughter and she buys into the project... </p>

A fun little game I play with the kids is to identify plants and flowers and have them guess the first letter of the name. It's amazing how they are now able to identify so many plants in our yard just from playing this simple game. </p>
<p>A few days ago my 2.5 year old son started yelling, &quot;Mommy! Come quick! Come quick!&quot; Thinking the worst, I dashed over, grabbed him by the shoulders and asked, &quot;What is it? For God's sake, man, what is it?&quot; &quot;The poppies are here!&quot; he yelled. The giant, orange Chinese poppies we've been waiting for, finally had started blooming, and they were stunning. It was pretty stunning, too, to see him so excited about something so natural.</p>

				<p>As <a href="http://knittinmom.blogspot.com/2007/05/greenin-it-up.html">Chrissy posted last week on her blog,</a> I too was a newbie to the <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/plastic-recycling.php">Master Recycler plastics roundup</a> held earlier this month. While I'd washed all my plastics prior to the morning of the roundup, I had not sorted in any way, shape or form. So I spend much of that Saturday morning sorting plastic bags, clamshells, tubs, etc.. </p>
<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1066,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/29/recyclebin1_2.jpg"><img width="200" height="266" border="0" src="../../../images/2007/05/29/recyclebin1_2.jpg" title="Recyclebin1_2" alt="Recyclebin1_2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>
But with the roundup under my belt, it clarified what I needed to do to organize our house for recyclables that are not part of the curbside program. The first thing was to <a href="../../../2007/04/baby_step_chang/">put recycle bins on each floor</a> (we live in a 3-story house with the garage on the basement level). So now we have a recycle bin in the main-level kitchen, competing with our normal garbage can (under the sink) and the compost bin (on the counter). We also have a recycle bin on the second-story at the end of the hall. Having these bins has ensured that magazines, newspapers, shampoo bottles, post-it notes, plastic bags, etc. all make it to designated recycling programs. </p>
<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1066,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/29/sortcenter_2.jpg"><img width="200" height="266" border="0" src="../../../images/2007/05/29/sortcenter_2.jpg" title="Sortcenter_2" alt="Sortcenter_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"/></a>
So this final step was setting up a sort center in the basement. I put it next to our yellow bins, where we collect all the recyclables for the curbside program. Now, it's not in any way pretty, mind you, but it does the job. Since it's in the basement, I wasn't too concerned about the pretty factor. What's especially cool is that all the bins are reused in some way. The shelving is our former baby changing table, with a few bins that used to hold diapers, wipes, etc. The numbered cardboard boxes are from Costco or old moving boxes, and I'll fill in as I get more (right now there are just spaces for a few of the numbered plastics). On the very top, there's a box for non-numbered plastics. As a KidTip, my preschooler enjoys helping me find the numbers on the items and put them in the proper place in the sorting center. And her vision is a lot sharper than mine, so this is a truly helpful thing!</p>

The story goes that if you build it, the fairies will come. The book, which we finally read last week, offers tips for building these little structures, which can be as primitive or elaborate as your child wants. The idea is to encourage exploration and respect of nature: the fairies won't come to any houses if leaves or branches have been pulled off trees in order to make it. It's also a great exercise in creativity and problem-solving: how can we set up these little twigs to support a roof? Can we make a hammock out of a fallen leaf and two twigs? </p>
<p>So for the past two summers, we've built numerous fairy houses around our yard. For the most part they've been very simple and easily toppled in a light wind. But it's been great to watch my daughter, and now my son, scavenging for twigs, getting their fingers dirty and imagining how delighted the fairies will be when they find their new house. Check out the <a href="http://www.fairyhouses.com/home.html">fairy house Web site</a> and see what other kids are building (some of them are pretty amazing). Building fairy houses is a great substitute for watching Bob the Builder on a sweet, summer day.</p>
