I&#39;m at a loss to explain any miracles of mood over the last 7 days. But I&#39;ve got the holiday spirit now, in spades. Whereas last week, I was all boo-boo. Wah, wah, I can&#39;t deal with this. Even thinking about the gifts on my list made me want to crawl into a ball and take a nap. Oh, perhaps it&#39;s due to Heather&#39;s being in a galaxy, far, far away. Whatever the change, I&#39;m happy to be happy right now. And wishing the holiday season was longer! So much to do! So little time! <br/><br/>My husband and I went out on Sunday night (crazy!) to see <a href="http://www.pcs.org/santaland-2010/" target="_self">The Santaland Diaries at the Gerding, put on by Portland Center Stage</a> (and thank you, thank you, thank you <a href="http://www.pcs.org/inside-pcs/" target="_self">PCS</a> for the free tix -- thanks even more for writing &#39;VIP Comp&#39; on them, because, you know, EnviroMoms like to feel important). It was our first visit to the Gerding in the <a href="http://www.pcs.org/about-the-armory/" target="_self">remodeled Armory</a>. And it&#39;s a totally amazing space for live theater, and I just love that they took an old historic building, and turned it into something fabulous and new. <br/><br/>But the play? Oh man, did we laugh. And hoot and howl and cry happy tears of holiday joy. It was that good. Wade McCollum is that actor&#39;s actor who makes his job look easy. He takes the hilarous David Sedaris tale of working as a Macy&#39;s elf and rocks it. Like many holiday classics, this one takes on the commercialism and craziness of the season, but gets to the heart of what it can mean in a heartwarming, funny and surprising way. I can&#39;t recommend this show more heartily enough. Especially if you have a sort of evil sense of humor, like we do, and don&#39;t mind a few f-bombs. The Santaland Diaries will run through January 2, but it&#39;s a super intimate theater (the Ellyn Bye Studio) and many shows have already sold old. <br/><br/>Typically, I&#39;ll get tickets for a holiday kids&#39; show, or a scaled-down version of the Nutcracker. My girls will get glammed up in their holiday dresses. And we&#39;ll go get a treat after the show. Nothing original here. Just a family ritual of enjoying a live holiday performance, an experience together, vs. spending all of my dear husband&#39;s hard-earned paycheck on stuff. You know? All that awful stuff that the holidays can easily devolve into being about? <br/><br/>I do realize that theater tickets are dear, and times are tough. So, maybe you&#39;ll do what we did: save the primo experience for the grown-ups and perhaps, take the kids in their fancy get-ups to a free or low-cost holiday event. There are so many in my town of Portland, right about now. As surely there are in yours. Then, most importantly, give yourself permission not to buy a few gifts. Because most of us don&#39;t need them. And we won&#39;t remember many of them. But we hopefully will cherish and remember the invaluable time and experiences shared.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The <a href="../../2009/10/time-for-more-buynothingnew-halloween-costumes/" target="_self">EnviroMom buy-nothing-new Halloween costume challenge</a> is pleased to kick off its third year! Your options are many. Swap costumes with friends and neighbors! Create something new-to-you by shopping in your closets or by tapping into your local thrift stores. Talk your younger kid into reusing a costume one of your older kids used several years back. Just <em>don&#39;t buy anything new</em> when decking out your kids in their Halloween duds this year. It&#39;s easy and fun! <br/><br/>Our family has gotten over the first hurdle in record time, I might add. The kids named their costumes of choice, to which I had no objections, therefore wasted no energy in trying to convince them to be something easier to make. We even got basic ingredients for our costumes at end-of-summer rummage sales to the tune of two dollars. Nicely done! Thankyouverymuch! <br/><br/>Without further ado, I present the artists&#39; costume renderings (and these were drawn by my kids, not me):<br/><br/> <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013487f62469970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Penguin-rendering" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e2013487f62469970c image-full" src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013487f62469970c-800wi.jpg" title="Penguin-rendering"/></a> <br/>Behold the penguin, clutching an egg at its feet. Don&#39;t ask me how we&#39;re going to manage the egg part. But my 6-year-old has been working on her penguin waddle. <br/><br/> <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4d65757970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Morgan-le-fay-costume-rendering" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4d65757970b image-full" src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4d65757970b-800wi.jpg" title="Morgan-le-fay-costume-rendering"/></a> <br/>Next, we present the enchantress of Camelot, Morgan le Fay. My 8-year-old is a big fan of the Magic Treehouse book series, where Morgan le Fay plays a recurring role as librarian. <br/><br/>We&#39;ve had a few recent rainy Sundays that have given me time to start working on the costumes, and oh, they are super fun and looking good. I can&#39;t wait to share the finished costumes with you! Are you planning buy-nothing-new Halloween costumes this year? Share your ideas! Send pictures as they come together! Let us help brainstorm your costume challenges.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4b46fa3970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Silly-bands" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4b46fa3970b image-full" src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4b46fa3970b-800wi.jpg" title="Silly-bands"/></a> <br/>Do you know why they call them <a href="http://www.sillybandz.com/" target="_self">Silly Bandz</a>? Well, because you&#39;d have to be silly to shell out 6 bucks for a small packet of animal-shaped rubber bands, for crying out loud! Silly is a pretty kind descriptor if you ask me. I&#39;ll violate one of the house rules and call them downright stupid.<br/><br/>On the week school started, I did not know what Silly Bandz were. A friend mentioned them over coffee, and how they&#39;d been banned already in New York schools. What seemed like moments later, my kids were feverishly trading them on the playground with their peers after soccer practice. Turns out one of my kids had gotten some as a perk for sitting through her dental cleaning. Who knew? <br/><br/>While they&#39;ve yet to be banned in our school, they are met with groans and moans from the teachers and parents alike. I&#39;d support a ban. I will also add them to the list of throw-away entertainments I deplore: balloons, party goody bags, party noisemakers, stickers, temporary tattoos, and kids&#39; meal prizes. <br/><br/>One mom friend says she was able to sway one of her kids away from these things early on, by explaining they are bad for the environment. Brain child of an Ohio company (Heather, girlfriend, you have your work cut out for you over there…) They are made in (you guessed it) China. Of silicone, or shall we say &#39;silly-cone&#39;? There&#39;s an unfounded internet rumor that they are made from, get this, recycled condoms!!. What I&#39;ve noticed so far is that Silly Bandz are super easy to break, lose (and find!). I&#39;ve found several among the bark chips on local playgrounds. So if I can find them, so can birds. Yet unlike the birds, I have no interest in eating them (especially if they really are made from recycled condoms!). But I imagine it&#39;s only a matter of time before Silly Bandz and their imitators start showing up in the stomachs of sea turtles, fish and birds. <br/><br/>My older daughter might be swayed by my friend&#39;s line of green thinking. After all, we&#39;ve been surrounding ourselves with the beauty and wonder of plant and animal &#39;<a href="../../2010/09/loving-life/" target="_self">Life</a>&#39; lately. But my younger kid? Not so much. She wants, wants, wants and doesn&#39;t have that kind of discernment yet. I will keep working on her. REDUCE, Reuse, Recycle and all that. Maybe some day it will sink in. But I do promise one thing. I won&#39;t be buying any new silly-cone rubber bands for my kids from here on out. Who&#39;s with me?</p>

<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20134858a2710970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Ban-plastic-bag" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20134858a2710970c image-full " src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20134858a2710970c-800wi.jpg" title="Ban-plastic-bag"/></a> <br/> I had the opportunity to serve on a mayoral task force last summer when Mayor Sam Adams sought input from various groups on promoting reusable bags, and getting away from single-use bags. Amazing how complicated things get when you have representatives of various voices at the table: seniors, community organizers speaking on behalf of various ethic and lower-income populations, representatives from the larger grocery stores and small business owners, and environmental concerns from plastic abolitionists to those representing big recycling advocacy groups, and little ol&#39; me, just happy to be there. It was a fascinating process. Then the <a href="../../2009/08/enviromom-supports-seattle-green-bag-campaign-approve-refendum-1/">bag tax in Seattle was voted down</a>, and the economy plummeted. And the bag thing fell off the radar.<br/><br/>Flash-forward to now. Bags are back, baby! What&#39;s cool is it looks like Portland will try to blaze a bag ban trail, and get something going prior to the state legislation, but that the city and state will work in harmony so that once it&#39;s all in place (hopefully) Oregonians will be dealing with the same bag rules across the state. Read all about the <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/index.cfm?c=53123">proposed details of the Portland bag ban</a>. And the <a href="http://www.markhass.com/plasticbags/">proposed Oregon bag plan</a>.<br/><br/>Couple of things. Of course, there&#39;s a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Portland-OR/Surfrider-Foundation-Portland-Chapter/26994271301?v=app_4949752878">Facebook page: Ban the Bag! A campaign to end single use plastic bags in Portland</a> (sponsored by the local chapter of the Surfrider Foundation). Like it, or not. <br/><br/>Also, mark your calendars for plastic bag d-day, August 1, Portlanders. Major retailer Fred Meyer will give this bad-boy a test run in all its Portland stores and seek feedback. No more &#39;free&#39; single use plastic bags. They will have paper available, and will promote the purchase of the reusable handled bags (it&#39;s unclear if the paper bags will require a 5 cent fee as legislation proposes). It does not appear Fred Meyer has set up a web page for this, but they do seek feedback via email: <a href="mailto:bagfeedback@fredmeyer.com">bagfeedback@fredmeyer.com</a>. <br/><br/>Personally, I can&#39;t wait. There may be some huge opportunities to see grown ups acting like toddlers having ugly, loud, in-public meltdowns on August 1st and beyond when they find out their old, faithful free plastic bag is no longer an option. Bring your video cameras. Remember, America&#39;s Funniest Videos pays out big bucks if you capture these things on tape. Of course, you probably have to get the tantrum-thrower&#39;s permission before you can enter the video into any contests, which might be a tougher challenge. <br/><br/>It&#39;s about damn time Portland and Oregon ban these single-use plastic bags, and show some leadership. Thank you Sam Adams and Mark Haas for the proposed legislation. Your thoughts?

				<p>OK, so when is living a waste-free lifestyle going to become an Olympic sport? I think we start petitioning the Olympic Committee right after you read this...</p><p>Now, Heather and I strive to keep garbage to a minimum within our two EnviroMom households, and we boast putting out only <a href="../../join-enviromoms-one-can-a/">one garbage can of waste per month</a>. Respectable for families of four, with kids! Because you&#39;ve probably heard that the average American family produces 4.5 pounds of garbage per person per day. So imagine, if you will, an Oregon couple who produced a mere 3 pounds IN A YEAR! Yes, you read that right. Three pounds.<br/><br/>Thanks to Willamette Week, I just read about <a href="http://wweek.com/columns/hotseat/">Amy and Adam Korst, of Dallas, Oregon, who have just completed their Green Garbage Project</a>. A year of striving to live trash free, with a fan-flippin-fantastic result of only having 3 pounds of garbage after their extreme waste-free adventure. <br/><br/>So what, you may ask, did they end up tossing? Some rubber gloves, a few light bulbs, the lining from a box of Cracker Jack, the blister packaging from a year&#39;s worth of birth control pills, the heads from some razors, among other things. Not a whole heck of a lot. Just goes to show what you can do when you put your mind to it. <br/><br/>Read all about the Korst couple&#39;s garbage free adventure at <a href="http://greengarbageproject.adammathiasdesign.com/">GreenGarbageProject.com</a>.

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				As part of the <a href="../../2010/04/super-excited-about-solar-check-out-solarize-southwest/">Solarize Southwest Portland project</a>, I signed up for a home energy review sometime in the past, such that I really didn&#39;t remember that I&#39;d done so and was a bit surprised when the folks at Energy Trust of Oregon called with a sudden opening, and asked if they could come over right away. I was home, so agreed, and then had to scramble to pick up all the dirty socks, etc. <br/><br/>Great service! You might think that an EnviroMom would have all this stuff down, right? Um, ha! I do have the thought cross my mind about low-flow shower heads just about every time I take a shower, but then by the time I&#39;ve toweled off and gotten dressed, that thought is gone and won&#39;t return until the next shower. Same deal with CFLs. Oh yeah. I&#39;ve heard the technology has improved. But I still curse some of the ones I have that seem to take 3 hours to fully warm up. Heck, I even had to revert back to one incandescent flood light in my kitchen because the long, dark winter and spring were killing me. Waiting for those CFLs to light up? I sometimes found myself curled up asleep on the kitchen floor, wondering why the coffee wasn&#39;t made yet. Sink faucet aerators? Truth be told, the thought never crossed my mind. In some ways, this can be blamed on denial. Our bathrooms had all been remodeled in that last 10 years. How bad could any of our stuff be? Well, apparently, bad enough. The great guy from Energy Trust replaced every shower head, every sink faucet aerator, and replaced 10 incandescent bulbs with LIghtwiz CFLs (and these ones are much better). Oh, and did I mention that it was all free? Score!<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f0ee02b3970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Sink-aerator" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f0ee02b3970b image-full " src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f0ee02b3970b-800wi.jpg" title="Sink-aerator"/></a> <br/> All told, here&#39;s what I learned:<br/><ul>
<li>Some of the stuff I had in my brain about CFLs was old data. They can now be used in &#39;closed&#39; light fixtures. Originally, that was not recommended. There are also now dimmable ones, which I&#39;ll check into. </li>
<li>Not only will the shower heads and sink aerators save water, but they&#39;ll also save energy when running hot, as less water gets heated. Never thought about that. </li>
<li>It behooves you to find out your fridge&#39;s birthday. I was told that 1993 and 2003 were big years for improved refrigerator efficiency. Turns out ours is from… 1992. Wah. While I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll go out and buy a new refrigerator in the next couple of days, it was helpful to learn that ours is likely fairly inefficient and that if we start saving for a new one, it&#39;d be better to replace it sooner rather than later. </li>
<li>They left me a form outlining &#39;opportunities&#39; to save, which include things like having more insulation and sealing done. </li>
<li>There was also a nice booklet explaining the cash incentives available for home energy improvements. </li>
</ul>
Have you had a home energy review done recently? Do other states offer this kind of fantastic program?

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				We took our optional <a href="../../2010/04/family-friendly-field-trip-to-a-transfer-station/">school field trip to the transfer station</a> last Wednesday. My kids plugged their noses as if on cue:<br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20134818125b9970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Stinky-garbage" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20134818125b9970c image-full " src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20134818125b9970c-800wi.jpg" title="Stinky-garbage"/></a> To tell you the truth, I didn&#39;t find the dump that impressive that day. The piles weren&#39;t very big (nor very smelly): <br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133ee517531970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Public-dump-area" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133ee517531970b image-full " src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133ee517531970b-800wi.jpg" title="Public-dump-area"/></a> <br/> Although this pile of corrugated cardboard was pretty awesome, such that one kid asked if they could climb it:<br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013481812673970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cardboard" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e2013481812673970c image-full " src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013481812673970c-800wi.jpg" title="Cardboard"/></a> <br/> The thing that really grabbed my kids&#39; attention was the discussion of hazardous waste. The haz-mat man in his white protective kevlar suit talked about how rechargeable batteries can react when they come together, and can ignite or explode. Likewise, old chemicals hanging out in your old grandpa&#39;s basement for years can separate and become so dangerous as to warrant calling the bomb squad for safe handling (which happens several times a month)! My kids&#39; ears perked up for that part, and when we talked about it later this was their main take-away. <br/><br/>One family had smartly brought a basket of batteries with them (why, oh, why do I never remember to do this?), which led to a discussion of why we need to cut back on the throwaway stuff in our lives. It would have been a perfect time for Jack Johnson to step out from behind one of the garbage piles and get us all singing along to the &#39;Three Rs,&#39; but alas, he must have been booked elsewhere that day. I&#39;d imagine most of the good moms and dads who took their kids on the optional field trip had the song all cued up in the car, for the drive back to school, or else they were prepared to launch into <a href="../../2008/05/kindergarteners/">EnviroMom Speech A: The importance of Reduce/Reuse/Recycle</a>.

My mother was adjusting my white tulle veil. Can you blame her? I&#39;m her only daughter. There&#39;s only one first communion, and not a whole lot of other opportunities in life to dress all in white with a veil! Lo and behold, her ring snagged on my veil while primping. Ripping a giant hole in the back. Somehow I remained unaware of this mini calamity or forgot (because, heck, I looked great from the front, and what else matters?). Years later, after spying the veil in a closet, I got it out to play dress-up. After my clandestine playing, I noticed the hole. And came to the immediate conclusion that I must have done it, and holy cow, was I ever going to be in BIG TROUBLE if my mom found out. It wasn&#39;t until my oldest daughter started preparing for her first communion that I learned the real story. Phew! One less thing to go to confession for. <br/><br/>My mom had bought a first communion dress at a rummage sale several years ago, and it has been waiting in the closet (pawed and drooled over for some time by my two girls). My oldest, bless her heart, asked if she could wear my old veil with the second-hand dress, after I mentioned I could probably fix it by replacing the tulle. It turned out to be a simple afternoon project. Nothing like <a href="../../2010/04/replacing-a-jacket-zipper-have-i-lost-my-mind/">replacing a zipper</a>. <br/><br/>Now this coming May, my mom and I, along with the rest of our families will get to see our beautiful daughter walk down the aisle in the white veil I once wore. My mom and I promise to be cautious (and ring-free!) when primping. <br/><br/>I am like a broken record in our home when it comes to Reduce and Reuse. Sometimes I think my words falls on deaf ears. But when my daughter asked if she could wear my old veil, I knew the message had gotten through. It is a blessing to raise a child who doesn&#39;t look down on second-hand goods and values vintage over new. Holes and all.

				<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a8cf0184970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Paper-box" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a8cf0184970b image-full " src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a8cf0184970b-800wi.jpg" title="Paper-box"/></a> <br/> We&#39;ve been reading aloud some of the <a href="http://www.beverlycleary.com/characters/henry.html">Beverly Cleary books about Henry Huggins</a> and Scooter McCarthy. I think they&#39;re sweet. In case you don&#39;t remember, Scooter has a paper route. Henry gets to sub for him while Scooter&#39;s on vacation. While I never had a paper route, these books remind me of when I was a kid and the paper always got delivered by some neighborhood kid on a bike and it was rolled up with a rubber band.<br/><br/>Here&#39;s where I go all Andy Rooney on you… Now it&#39;s these darned plastic bags! And it&#39;s not a neighborhood kid. It&#39;s someone with a drivers&#39; license who speeds down your street at about 40 miles per hour tossing the paper in a plastic bag onto your driveway (if you&#39;re lucky), and you never see them because it&#39;s too dark and they&#39;re going too fast. The plastic bags are so worthless and thin that they usually rip on impact and land in a big puddle getting the paper all wet. I put them in my reuse/recycle center where they breed like rabbits (They do! I swear!), threatening to take over my house. I&#39;m not making this up.<br/><br/>I figured I had a few options to reduce the amount of plastic bags coming into my life. I could quit subscribing to the paper and read it online, but refuse to do that:<br/>1) Because I have a degree in journalism and I like reading this paper in paper-form, and I know people who work there, and I want to keep this newspaper in business. Well, I guess I don&#39;t need a #2. That&#39;s the gist of it. (Did I really just say I majored in journalism and can&#39;t make a numbered list with two coherent points? Oy.)<br/><br/>The other option would be to get one of those boxes on my mailbox post so the delivery person could put it in there and then not need the plastic bag. Genius! I contacted the paper&#39;s customer service, and they said they&#39;d have one installed right away. That was last June. Still nothing. So I chatted with a neighbor who just happened to have one of those paper boxes in his garage that he was not using and gave to me. I&#39;ve dragged and dragged and dragged my heels, but finally put the thing up over the past weekend. The delivery person of course has not used or noticed it yet since he/she is too busy flying down our street like an Olympic bobsled competitor. So the last step in this crazy &#39;reduce plastic bag scheme&#39; is the well-worded letter:<br/><blockquote>Dear Newspaper Delivery Person, <br/><br/>I am on your route. I get the daily paper. I now have one of those bright yellow newspaper boxes on my mailbox post. It&#39;s so very bright yellow, I can&#39;t see how you&#39;ve missed it. But you have. For several days now. Please start delivering my paper in that box and <strong>please do not include the plastic bag</strong>. I wouldn&#39;t mind a rubber band, if necessary.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>Renee<br/></blockquote>I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed. I don&#39;t know why I have such low expectations on this front. I think I better reword that letter a bit.

Since he doesn&#39;t have kids, he wanted our input on diapers. And of course, we were a bit chagrined because neither of our families were in any way green when it came to diapers. Yes, we did not drink the green Koolaid until our AFTER our kids were out of their Pampers and Huggies. We sure have a heck of a lot of nerve calling ourselves EnviroMom after that admission, no??<br/><br/><p>Anywhoo. His question was this: is it possible to be a One Can A Month family if you do have kids in diapers? Most likely, if you use cloth diapers, it shouldn&#39;t be a problem right? If you opt for disposable diapers, is One Can A Month out of the question? Is wanting to go to One Can A Month ample enough reason to switch from disposables? It&#39;d be cool to get your input. So please. If you will… Calling all diaper families! Is One Can A Month possible for the diaper set? And for those of you who do cloth diaper, is it a whole ton of work, or not as burdensome as you thought it might be? </p><p>(The photo is my second daughter at about a week old (she&#39;s 5 now). Her thought bubble is screaming: MOM! Are you kidding me with these disposable Pampers? Really??!)</p>
