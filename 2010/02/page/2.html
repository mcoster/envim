		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Just before we rang in the New Year I proclaimed 2010 to be <a href="../../../../2009/12/resolution-2010-the-year-of-money/">The Year of Money</a>. Primarily saving money, and one of the ways I proposed to do this was to start meal planning. For me, cooking dinner has been like that recurring dream where I&#39;m a contestant on a game show but wearing no pants.&#0160;Four o&#39;clock would roll around and I&#39;d start to panic because I couldn&#39;t think of anything to cook, and I&#39;d just get freaky and overwhelmed. So we&#39;d eat out. We were eating out or ordering take-out 2-3 times per week. And I&#39;m not talking about fast food here. I&#39;m talking about gourmet pizza and proper sit-down restaurants, which added up big time. But all of that has changed now. We have not eaten out as a family once in 2010. We will at some point, but for now I&#39;m devoted to home-cooked meals. Meal planning has transformed the way I approach dinnertime and has removed a huge amount of stress in my life. It&#39;s cut down tremendously on the amount of wasted food, and it has saved us money by not dining out.</p>
<p>The only meal I do any planning for is dinner, because breakfast and lunch around here seldom varies. I don&#39;t have a magic formula or use any kind of spread sheets. Once a week (seldom on the same day, but often on Wednesdays, not sure why)&#0160;I spend&#0160;an hour planning meals&#0160;for about 7-10 days out. Then I revisit the plan a few days later and tweak it if needed. Here&#39;s my process:</p>
<p>1. I use a week-at-a-glance day planner that has lots of space for each day. Yep, the paper kind. I love <a href="http://www.mixedroleproductions.com/index.html" target="_blank">this one</a> made of 100% recycled paper. (Thanks, Liz!) This allows me to see what&#39;s going on during the week, whether hub has a late meeting, daughter has basketball practice&#0160;or if I can see if time will be tight around dinner so I can plan accordingly. I write&#0160;in&#0160;pencil.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20128779022a7970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a>&#0160;<br/> 2. Then I pull up my Master Dinner List, a Word doc that simply lists entrees and where I can find the recipe if needed. What I&#39;ve learned about myself is that <em>I just need an idea on paper</em>. Just getting the idea, the name of an entree, is about 75% of the battle for me. Santa Fe Beef & Beans. Vegetable Lasagna. Grilled cheese sandwiches. I write down any dinner idea on the list, no matter how mundane. Right now I have about 40 entrees listed, and when I try something new and successful I add it to the list. I try to plan for at least two meals that will have leftovers for the following dinner. One night usually features pasta, one night homemade pizza.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a88d7f8b970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a>&#0160;<br/> 3. Once I&#39;ve jotted down my dinners in the planner I make a shopping list for about 4 days worth of food. Anything longer than that is asking for spoilage. I get out my binder of recipes (literally, a binder into which I&#39;ve taped recipes onto cardstock-weight paper in no particular order, aka organized mayhem) or whatever cookbooks I need, check ingredients, check to see what I already have and make a list. Then off to the store!</p>
<p>&#0160;<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20128779024e8970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a>&#0160;<br/> I cannot tell you how radically different dinnertime has become around here <em>because I have a plan and I&#39;m not stressed out</em>. The quality of our dinners has improved dramatically. We are throwing away almost nothing because I&#39;ve planned for leftovers. I&#39;ve earmarked all of the produce and meat that enters the fridge, and it all gets eaten. There is no room for error. In fact, most of the time our fridge looks pretty bare, and I love that. I know exactly what&#39;s in there. Amazing!&#0160;</p>
<p>I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m saving any money on groceries, but that wasn&#39;t really my intention. We&#39;re saving money by not eating out. I&#39;m not a coupon user and I like shopping at our local co-op and New Seasons Market, which is more expensive than, say, Winco. But I have a grocery budget, and I&#39;m sticking to it. Using <a href="http://www.mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint.com</a> helps me track how much I&#39;m spending at the grocery store so that I can see where I need to make adjustments.</p>
<p>Also, not eating out every week makes the <em>prospect</em> of eating out so much more special. Meeting a girlfriend for dinner. Date night. Celebrations. I savor these rare and special occasions now.</p>
<p>Are you meal planning? Have a system that you&#39;d like to share? Let&#39;s hear it!</p>

				A green-minded friend just had her first baby: a home-birth, mom, dad and babe are all doing swell -- lack of sleep, that crazy joyful adrenalin high, adoring new grandparents -- you know the drill. They&#39;ve chosen breastfeeding and cloth diapers. Now the trick is to find a daycare when the mom goes back to work that wouldn&#39;t laugh her out of town when asked to support those green choices. Here&#39;s her dilemma:<br/><blockquote>we&#39;re not sure a nanny makes sense financially and a daycare facility just isn&#39;t great for an infant (think put in a bouncy seat in the corner) not to mention they&#39;re expensive, so we&#39;re thinking a small group in home daycare makes the most sense. they are affordable, about half the cost of daycare, and i like the child:adult ratio. the trick with these of course is finding the right person in the right location. we&#39;re ideally looking for one that is willing to do cloth diapers, supports breastfeeding by giving pumped breastmilk and preferably incorporates green activities, education, and outdoor adventures into their daily routine, not to mention good, wholesome food. <br/></blockquote>So, how did <em>you</em> find daycare for your infant or older children that was affordable and in-line with the green choices you&#39;ve chosen in raising your child? I did suggest that my friend check out the <a href="http://ecohealthychildcare.org/index.php?page=parents">Eco-Healthy Childcare Directory</a> as a jumping off point.&#0160; <br/><br/>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a87be94a970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Freerangekids" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a87be94a970b image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a87be94a970b-800wi.jpg" title="Freerangekids"/></a>&#0160;<br/> Do you let your 8-year old roam the neighborhood unaccompanied? Walk to school without an adult? Lick raw cookie dough off the egg beaters? My answers are no, no and no. Why is that? I did all of these things when I was a kid, and I bet you did, too. I just finished reading a fantastic book that delves into modern-day parental fears and this over-the-top culture of &#39;keeping our kids safe.&#39; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470471948?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=readysetmomco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470471948"><em>Free-Range Kids</em> by Lenore Skenazy</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="../../../../e/ir_t_readysetmomco-20_l_as2_o_1_a_0470471948.jpg" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; MARGIN: 0px; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none" width="1"/> (the only parenting book I&#39;ve ever read cover to cover) is making me think really hard about my fears as a parent and why I have them. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve long been afraid of the man in the van that could&#0160;<em>at any moment</em>&#0160;pull up to our driveway and snatch my children away forever. Back in 1999 there were 115 child abductions by strangers, half of which ended in murder. Child abductions have been on the decline since then (by about 38%) so the chances of that ever happening are so minuscule that they barely register.&#0160;So why the fear?&#0160;Lenore points out a few things that contribute to parental fear:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 24-hour news cycle, which promotes the worst in society. One former TV news producer says, &quot;I can tell you that news is all about fear. Sometimes, the first criteria we used when judging a story involving children or families was, &#39;Is it scary enough?&#39;&quot; </li>
<li>The&#0160;many CSI-type television dramas, which love to come up with the most horrific crimes against children because those shows boost ratings. </li>
<li>The <em>What to Expect When You&#39;re Expecting</em> books and other books by parenting &#39;experts&#39;, which mostly set you up to fail because you can&#39;t possibly live up to all of the do&#39;s and don&#39;t&#39;s. </li>
<li>The myriad safety products like baby knee pads, helmets for children learning to walk and bath mats that tell you when the water is too hot (because it&#39;s so hard to tell by feeling it with your hand). There are so many safety products out there that you start believing that everything in your house is a hazard!</li>
</ul>
<p>So we parents become so over-protective that we don&#39;t give our kids a whole lot of room to explore and take risks (mild ones preferably) and develop confidence&#0160;and independence. We teach them to be afraid of strangers, when in reality, most people are really good. We don&#39;t let them out of our sight in the woods, so kids start to fear it (aka nature deficit disorder). I&#39;m tired of being afraid for my kids, and I&#39;m starting to see that it&#39;s a gross overreaction. </p>
<p>The other day Renee let her 8-year old walk by herself to my house for a playdate. It&#39;s about a 7-minute walk, down a&#0160;quiet residential street&#0160;past 15 houses. I was so impressed, and her daughter took it in stride. It&#39;s made me start looking for opportunities to let my own kids exert their independence. If I equip them with common sense and teach them what to do in case they need help (without freaking them out) why shouldn&#39;t they have the same freedoms I enjoyed as a child? I want them to explore their environment, to enjoy it, to not fear it. </p>
<p>Do you want this for your kids? Are you already giving it to them? Do you feel like you&#39;ve fallen into the fear trap?</p>
<p>I highly recommend <em>Free-Range Kids</em>. It&#39;s funny, informative and eye-opening. <a href="http://freerangekids.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Lenore&#39;s blog</a> is also chock-full of great stories, commiseration and support.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				Planning ahead has never been a strength in this family. Great ideas usually arrive a day late and a dollar short. But not so this year with valentines! We stumbled upon a cute and easy Reduce/Reuse idea for home-made valentines cards thanks to the Martha Steward Living magazine that mysteriously arrived in my mailbox a few weeks back (even thought I&#39;ve not subscribed). Martha&#39;s February issue had many mouthwatering Valentines&#39; Day inspirations, most of which we ignored (out waistlines will thank us later). But we did like an idea she had about making stamps with corrugated cardboard -- hers were little rosettes. We modified her idea and made hearts. Here&#39;s what the stamps look like:<br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2012877783b21970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Carboard-stamps" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e2012877783b21970c image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2012877783b21970c-800wi.jpg" title="Carboard-stamps"/></a> <br/> We used washable Crayola kid paints to ink the stamps (because of course we ended up with paint on our noses to our toes). Once the valentines dried overnight, the kids addressed and signed their cards. Here are some finished cards:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a875e479970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Valentines" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a875e479970b image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a875e479970b-800wi.jpg" title="Valentines"/></a> <br/> Easy peasy. No glitter. No mess. One-of-a-kid valentines. Nothing new or store-bought with characters and smart-alecky sayings. We had plenty of corrugated cardboard in the recycling bin to make our stamps. It did turn out that I had no cardstock for the cards, but we found a wealth of old file folders that were willing to be down-cycled into valentines. <br/><br/>If you have any easy valentines ideas you&#39;d like to share (especially those that Reduce / Reuse materials creatively), please send us a description and a photo. We&#39;ll feature them throughout the week. Let love with a spirit of Reduce / Reuse / Recycle fill the air for this year&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day!

Yesterday&#39;s test came by way of a stopped up sink in the kid&#39;s bathroom. I&#39;ve lamented in the past that <a href="../../../../2009/12/reducing-toothpaste-waste-and-reusing-dental-floss/">whole tubes of toothpaste have gone down this drain</a>. And hair and soap. Thus my day of reckoning arrived. Sigh.<br/><br/>I spent about two hours trying to snake and plunger the clog free yesterday. I ended up cross and disgusted by the primordial ooze that emanated from the sink. Inexplicably I also retrieved a vast amount of pine needles. Yet the dang-blasted clog would not break up. Ooooh how that devil on my shoulder kept whispering in my ear: &#39;drano…. liquid plumr foaming pipe snake….&#39; I googled all the natural enzymatic alternatives with nary a testament that promised that they really work. More along the lines of: use these to keep your drains running freely on a regular basis! Well, nuts to that. Google did of course bring up about 2 million instances of the vinegar and baking soda treatment which didn&#39;t appear worth my time given the beaver dam I seemed to be up against.<br/><br/>As a last ditch effort, I removed the drain trap and of course spilled murky water all over the bathroom floor and sadly, the clog was not there but beyond, deep in the pipes within the walls. Having arrived in DIY failure-ville, I called a plumber who brought his professional skills and snaked the clog out this morning. There really is nothing quite like a competent plumber to make you feel like everything is going to be alright. Or maybe that&#39;s just me. <br/><br/>Anyway, back to that &#39;ounce of prevention&#39; wisdom. He recommended some mesh strainers to keep the hair and gunk out first and foremost. Why oh why haven&#39;t I done this before? They are $2 apiece. I went on a shopping spree. I got one for every sink in the house! Oh, and he did say that antibacterial soaps are especially good at gumming up pipes, so that gives me yet another reason to remain steadfast against using them. <br/><br/>TGIF! Wishing everyone a lovely weekend with free-flowing drains and no sewer problems in sight!

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last week we talked a bit about the problematic styrofoam lunch trays that many schools are sending to the landfill every day, but frankly I&#39;m a bit more concerned about the stuff that&#39;s served on those trays. Here&#39;s the thing: the child nutrition programs, which include the nationwide school lunch program, will be coming up for renewal by Congress this spring. This only happens once every five years. According to <a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/campaign/time_for_lunch/" target="_blank">Slow Food International&#39;s Time for Lunch program</a>, the government reimburses schools $2.68 for every meal served to a child who qualifies for free lunch. After overhead expenses the schools really only have about $1 to spend on each lunch.&#0160;Have you&#0160;seen what $1 gets a kid for lunch? Blergh.&#0160;However, now that President Obama has declared a freeze on&#0160;domestic program funding, it seems really unclear whether necessary additional funding will be awarded, so maybe it&#39;s a moot point. (Or as Joey Tribbiani would say, a &#39;moo&#39; point.) But among healthy school lunch advocates,&#0160;hope remains that some additional funding will be granted.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here in Portland, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as bad as in other school districts (but it is far from great, and I only let my kids eat it once a week). Portland&#39;s kids have a fresh fruit and veggie bar, and occasionally some locally-sourced food,&#0160;in addition to the usual processed fare. But there is a <em>fascinating</em> blog by an anonymous teacher from Illinois&#0160;that you must check out if you feel strongly about school lunch. It&#39;s called <a href="http://fedupwithschoollunch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Fed Up with School Lunch</a>, and this teacher is eating, photographing&#0160;and blogging about the hot lunch served in her school every day in 2010 (or until she is outed and fired). The food is horrifying. </p>
<p>The sad thing is that 18 million children in the US qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and for many this is their only hot meal of the day. The typical hot lunch is massively over-processed and of dubious origin. It&#39;s the kind of food that is contributing to the rise of obesity and diabetes&#0160;in the US. (FYI: Oprah is doing a show on this epidemic today.) In December, USA Today released a report claiming that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-12-08-school-lunch-standards_N.htm" target="_blank">school lunch meat doesn&#39;t even meet the standards of many fast food chains</a>. Something is terribly wrong here.</p>
<p>What can you do? You aren&#39;t going to like it, but truly, contacting your&#0160;congresspeople is the best way to make reform happen. They need to hear that their constituents demand more money for healthier school lunches. An additional $1 per child could have a huge impact on the quality and source of food served in the schools. Actually, Slow Food is pushing for three specific changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the funding to give school lunch programs an additional $1 per child per day </li>
<li>Protect kids from the junk food sold in vending machines located in schools </li>
<li>Link schools to local farms to teach healthy eating. Guarantee $50 million for Farm to School programs.</li>
</ul>
I am sending a short, to-the-point message to my two US Senators and two Representatives because they need to hear from me. And you. You can find contact info at <a href="http://www.congress.org/" target="_blank">Congress.org</a> by entering your zip code. If you&#39;re really motivated, talk your&#0160;school principal and get her/his read on it, and see if you can organize a school-wide letter-writing campaign. THAT should send a message!

I don&#39;t understand it. Is there a parent or aunt or grandma in the developed world who hasn&#39;t seen a recall notice, or two or a thousand? Here&#39;s one of the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml10/10131.html">latest recalls on a Tiny Tink charm with excessive levels of lead</a>. Enough is enough on recalls due to lead or <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml10/10127.html">cadmium</a> or whatever poison they can paint a product with to make it shiny and pretty but still only retail for $2.99? <br/><br/>I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m ranting. But this drives me crazy! I appreciate the CPSC recalls that come out. I appreciate the efforts of manufacturers to try to test the products they sell. But the way I see it, the whole system is flawed, and the only way we as consumers can impact this is by refusing to buy this crap. I know I&#39;m preaching to the choir. We&#39;re probably not the main purchasers of this crap jewelry. <br/><br/>Regardless, I ask you: Will you join me in making a vow? <br/><blockquote>I promise to never buy crap jewelry for any kid ever again. <br/></blockquote>See! That&#39;s wasn&#39;t hard, was it? Well, here&#39;s the hard part: Have the important conversations with family and friends who do buy this crap jewelry. Do your utmost to get them to stop buying it. OK. I&#39;m finished (stepping off my soapbox now).

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve spent the past couple of weeks with my nose buried in my armpits. Anything? My husband still&#0160;welcomes my hugs, and the children continue to vie for the morning snuggle spot under my right arm, so I think it&#39;s working. IT&#39;S TOTALLY WORKING. I made deodorant, and I&#39;m loving it.</p>
<p>This is not the first time we&#39;ve lamented the state of our pits here on EnviroMom. We are motivated to&#0160;try alternative odor control&#0160;due to&#0160;the sketchy ingredients in our Secret antiperspirant, like aluminum.&#0160;Renee recently tried <a href="../../../../2009/11/baking-soda-as-a-natural-nontoxic-deodorant/">straight baking soda</a>, which she abandoned after concerns over a developing rash. We&#39;ve both tried out <a href="../../../../2008/03/sweating-the-sm/">store-bought natural deodorants</a> and discovered that the experience was akin to setting $20 on fire. Then there was the <a href="../../../../2008/06/experiment-usin/">tea tree oil</a> debacle of 2008. It started out with such promise! only to stop working after a few weeks. Woe to stinky tree-hugging mom! Now Renee is dabbing&#0160;her pits with&#0160;milk of magnesia (thank you <a href="http://www.peoplespharmacy.com/2010/01/16/milk-of-magnesia-as-deodorant-1/" target="_blank">People&#39;s Pharmacy</a>) and is cautiously optimistic. I, however, am holding out hope&#0160;for my latest concoction.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20128774d7f54970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Homemadedeodorant" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20128774d7f54970c image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20128774d7f54970c-800wi.jpg" title="Homemadedeodorant"/></a> <br/></p>
<p>This is not a new-fangled recipe. In fact, many of you are probably&#0160;using it already! But for me,&#0160;this has been a huge baby step. I&#39;ve always believed that I required an antiperspirant to stop the sweat and the odor. Now I&#39;m wondering whether the antiperspirant was <em>causing</em> me to feel a bit damp. Because, believe it or not, I actually sweat far less with this homemade deodorant. And when I do sweat, it doesn&#39;t stink. Go figure. I think that the &#39;invisible&#39; sheen of residue left by Secret was making me feel sweaty, whereas this homemade stuff absorbs into my skin leaving me feel dry. Here&#39;s the&#0160;recipe, which I got from <a href="http://simplemom.net/simple-homemade-deodorant-an-effective-safe-alternative/" target="_blank">Simple Mom</a>:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>In a small bowl combine 1/4 cup of baking soda with 1/4 cup of corn starch</p>
<p>Mash in&#0160;5-6 tablespoons of coconut oil with a fork, stirring until you get the desired consistency</p></blockquote>
<p>I halved that recipe to fit it into my tiny jam jar, which I just apply with my fingers.&#0160;But you can also scoop it into an&#0160;empty roll-up antiperspirant container for easy application. Since the coconut oil is a solid, the final product is almost identical to the consistency of a solid antiperspirant.&#0160;This recipe has a very mild, pleasing (to me) coconut scent, and I haven&#39;t experienced any rashes. I suspect this jam jar will last me until summer,&#0160;at which point&#0160;I may need to make some changes. Because the downside to using coconut oil&#0160;is that it liquifies once the temperature rises over 76 degrees. Fine in the winter, not so good in the summer. I&#39;m not sure keeping my deodorant in the fridge during warmer months will work for me, so I might experiment with milk of magnesia this summer. </p>
<p>So there it is, yet another chapter in the Armpit Chronicles. Stay tuned for our next installation! Will Renee backslide to Secret, or try a bold, new initiative like Listerine?! Will Heather be driven mad by the coconut odor and take to drinking pina coladas for breakfast?! Stay tuned...</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				Our Sunday paper ran a guest column from <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2010/01/knowledge_shrinks_as_our_waist.html">Jamie O&#39;Neill about the dumbing down of cookbooks titled &#39;Knowledge shrinks as our waists expand&#39;</a>. I&#39;m always into learning anything I can to keep my waist from expanding. The gist of the piece is that most Americans don&#39;t know how to cook due to our reliance on prepared foods. So that editors of cookbooks can assume very little comprehension of culinary terms by its users. Here&#39;s a telling excerpt:<br/><blockquote>Bonnie Slotnick, a woman who owns a rare cookbook shop in Greenwich Village, was quoted in an article about the uptick in culinary cluelessness, saying: &quot;Thirty years ago, a recipe would say, &#39;Add two eggs.&#39; In the &#39;80s, that was changed to &#39;beat two eggs until lightly mixed.&#39; By the &#39;90s, you had to write &#39;in a small bowl, using a fork, beat two eggs.&#39; We joke that the next step will be: &#39;Using your right hand, pick up a fork and….&quot; <br/></blockquote>Sad to say. I think I am that reader. I never learned to cook. I think there was a short course in home ec in middle school in which we made muffins and sewed a pot-holder. Neither my muffins nor pot-holder turned out very good. My mom was a great cook in my younger years, then moved to convenience foods when she went back to work. I didn&#39;t learned to cook with her (or anyone else in my family), nor did I take initiative to learn it on my own -- until I had my own kids and became freaked out enough by the ingredients in processed foods. As much as I sigh and groan when my kids ask if they can &#39;help&#39; when I cook, I usually agree even though it slows down the process immensely and threatens the end results. I hope that they will learn that cooking is fun, necessary and rewarding, and won&#39;t suffer from all the cooking insecurities that I have now. <br/><br/>How did you learn to cook? How are you teaching your kids the culinary arts?
