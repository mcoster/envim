I&#39;ll confess that entertaining is not my forté. If it&#39;s anything more complex than having a kid or two over for a playdate, I start to lose it. I dream of emulating certain friends who entertain with such grace and elegance. The planning, the decisions, trying to balance my green goals with highly competitive considerations like cost and convenience. All of it leaves me wanting to crawl into bed and pull the covers over my head and bleat out: &#39;I want my mommy.&#39; Thankfully, my mom has been visiting for the past week, helping with the planning, prep and cleaning. My husband&#39;s mom too. I hate to tell you this, but I do have the best mother-in-law in the world. Sorry everyone. Someone had to get her. I hope I am deserving. <br/><br/>I&#39;d like to say having a celebration gets easier as time goes on. Yet for me, it doesn&#39;t. I find myself waking up at 4am thinking of all the million tasks still to do, and wondering if I&#39;ll even survive! But guess what? I did! And I do feel there were some lessons to share from our most recent greenish celebration:<br/><ul>
<li>Ask for help, and accept it when it is offered. I HATE to ask for help. I don&#39;t know why. But every friend and neighbor that I asked, gladly gave me exactly what I needed, and then some. Heather loaned me a big cooler so that I could chill beer on the back patio. Our chicken neighbors had enviable blooms on rhodies and other plants in their yard, and gladly let me snip as many as I needed for vases, providing (for free!) all the floral decor at the party. My aunt volunteered to make a gluten-free dessert, when I was starting to get seriously overwhelmed. My mother-in-law made some of her famous Filipino delicacies: pancit (a noodle dish) and lumpia (eggroll). Yummmmmm….</li>
<li>Food? We made a few compromises. While I resisted buying commercially processed food, we did buy a heck of a lot of out-of-season produce in rigid plastics (that I normally would NEVER get), so issues of food miles? Um, well, don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell. While I&#39;m normally such a zealot about this, I had to keep reminding myself that we don&#39;t entertain often and a party should be special. We should be allowed to break some rules. </li>
<li>Ditto on the bubbly water. Bottled water! I know, I know! Repeat above mantra: It&#39;s a party and should be special!</li>
<li>I did not need a new outfit. Heck, I thought about it for a long time. I kept thinking I would shop a bit and treat myself. Time wise, I never could fit it in, and you know what? I think I looked pretty good simply because I don&#39;t dress up often -- so when I do pull out a skirt from the back of my closet that hasn&#39;t gotten a lot of wear, it works. </li>
<li>We did not need to go nuts over the yard, deck or landscape. My husband mowed the grass, and we put out some picnic blankets. I did dust off our lawn chairs, as they&#39;ve been in deep storage for the winter months. It did not matter that the cushions are sun-faded and missing a few buttons. </li>
<li>The <a href="../../../../2010/05/party-down-durable-party-pack-rocks/">party kits</a> were a major hit! Several adults told me how much they liked the colorful kid plates, as they sampled lots of different things but did not overindulge. It worked well for the kids too, since they didn&#39;t heap their plates full of broccoli and carrots to make their parents happy, then throw it all out once the folks weren&#39;t looking and they could make a bee-line to the desserts. Somehow I have mis-located (I refuse to say &#39;lost&#39;) one cloth napkin. I&#39;m hoping it will still turn up. Since all of the serve-ware was plastic, nothing was broken!</li>
<li>You can write &#39;no gifts, please&#39; on the evite, yet many of your guests will ignore that request. Again, that&#39;s ok. It&#39;s a party. It&#39;s a lesson in graciousness. It gives my kids a chance to practice writing &#39;thank you notes.&#39; </li>
<li>Plan ahead. I am not a fancy baker, but I can make cookies. In the weeks before the party, I made several batches of cookie dough while my kids were at school, and froze them. I baked them (again, while the kids were at school) right before the celebration. I was so glad I did this. </li>
<li>Even if you are having mostly family over, you have to invite your best friend. I can&#39;t tell you how many times Heather said exactly the right thing at the right minute. Such as: &#39;You look gorgeous! Your daughter is a vision in white! The service was wonderful. The food spread is glorious.&#39; </li>
</ul>
When all is said and done, it was a joyful celebration. There was plenty of food and drink. The weather was delightful. We even had a ton of family and friends come to the church and witness the First Communion, which was important to my daughter and to me. There came a point in my pre-celebration stress when I started to let it all go. Would trimming the hedge really make it a better party? Probably not. People will still have a good time, bushy hedge and all. So perhaps, greenish entertaining does get easier with practice and perspective. Just like greening your lifestyle. It&#39;s a million little baby steps, and it all works out in the end.

<p>Do you have a power drink? Something that you crave when you need a little pick-me-up? I think I&#39;ve found mine: green smoothies. I&#39;ve long made <a href="../../../../2010/03/plotting-this-summers-berry-preservation-strategy/">fruit smoothies with a yogurt base</a>, which are yummy, but they never left me feeling refreshed and energized. (Frankly, I can&#39;t think of a beverage that&#39;s ever given me that kind of lift. Coffee, sure, but more for its gentle wake-me-up properties.) A few weeks ago <a href="http://beautythatmoves.typepad.com/beauty_that_moves/2010/04/if-i-could-gift-one-thing-to-myself-everyday.html" target="_blank">I read about green smoothies&#0160;at Beauty that Moves</a>&#0160;(and more <a href="http://beautythatmoves.typepad.com/beauty_that_moves/2010/04/green-smoothie-answers-and-bonus-random-thoughts.html" target="_blank">here</a>), and I just had to try it.&#0160;Holy. Totally sold.</p>
<p>The green part comes from, well, greens. Spinach, kale, chard, romaine...whatever you like. I&#39;ve been using kale because I think you get more for your money. (I also just planted some, and it&#39;s growing like crazy!) You need a pretty powerful blender to get the greens and the fruit all chopped up and smooth, and luckily&#0160;our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MF8A8C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=readysetmomco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000MF8A8C">KitchenAid Pro Line blender</a> really does the trick. I run it on high for about one minute.&#0160;A <a href="http://www.vitamix.com/index.asp" target="_blank">Vita-Mix</a> would be awesome. Cheaper blenders probably aren&#39;t strong enough, but you can always do a little test on a few pieces of kale or spinach and some water to see if it will break down enough. Big chunks of greens floating in your glass probably wouldn&#39;t be that appetizing.</p>
<p>So far, I&#39;ve pretty much stuck with one basic (loose) recipe, which gives me about 40 oz of smoothie. One glass for me and my husband in the morning, and another for me at lunch:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>1 cup of ice</p>
<p>2.5 cups of water</p>
<p>1 apple cored</p>
<p>1 banana or ripe pear</p>
<p>2-3 cups chopped kale</p>
<p>1 tablespoon maple syrup</p></blockquote>
<p>When berries are in season, I&#39;ll be freezing and adding them in.&#0160;I think you could pretty much use whatever fruit you like because the tiny bit of sweetener eliminates any strong &#39;green&#39; flavor. Heck, with the berries you might not even need the sweetener. To me, the smoothie just tastes fresh. Very mildly sweet.&#0160;I like mine kind of watery, so I&#39;ll just add more water and blend it until I get the right consistency. My husband really likes them, but the kids...not so much. (They like the yogurt kind.) I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I feel kind of logy if I don&#39;t have one. It just makes me feel vibrant, alive, alert. I also love that I&#39;m getting all of these fruits & veggies into my diet in one tasty drink!</p>
<p>The other part that&#39;s cool is you can keep&#0160;this drink&#0160;pretty local. The bananas, obviously, are not, but they aren&#39;t necessary. This summer it will be berry and apple-fueled. Oh, and peaches! In the fall, we&#39;ll add in pears. It will be fun to play around with different combos. The greens can always be found locally (at least here in Portland) at the farmers market or grocery stores.</p>
<p>Have you tried green smoothies? What combos do you like?</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>We first posted about our friend Christy K., a brilliant and lovely fellow <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler</a> co-hort of ours, when she envisioned putting together a <a href="../../../../2008/02/birthday-party/">durable party kit for her son&#39;s birthday party</a>, then had to pretty much pull an all-nighter to finish sewing all the cloth napkins in time (which totally sounds like something I would do). </p><p>This is the first time I&#39;ve had an opportunity to actually see her party kit and rent it for a gathering of our own. Yes, if you&#39;ve been following along with my posts -- it is game time. My beautiful girl gets to <a href="../../../../2010/04/celebrating-a-family-culture-of-reuserepair/">put on that white veil</a>, walk down the aisle and experience First Holy Communion this Sunday. We&#39;re having a little feast / gathering with the grand-parents and God-parents afterward. If you know anything about me, you know I wouldn&#39;t be caught dead buying paper plates, napkins and throwaway plastic utensils! Well, um, OK. That last party I just might have used paper plates made from recycled content. But that was several years ago, and I&#39;m much more evolved in my eco-freakness now. This time, there was NO WAY I could hold my head up high and serve people on paper plates, with paper napkins and plastic forks. Absolutely not. Plus there&#39;s no way I could accommodate that amount of trash given our commitment to <a href="../../../../join-enviromoms-one-can-a/">putting out just one garbage can a month</a>. </p><p>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013480b91054970c-pi" style="float: right;"></a> But of course, here I have no excuses, because Christy has done all the work and put together not one, but TWO party kits that she rents to friends and neighbors for a nominal fee. It is just so beautifully and efficiently done that I had to post about it today! She&#39;s got a nice tub with lid to keep it all together. Each kit contains:</p><ul>
<li>30 small plates</li>
<li>30 small cups</li>
<li>30 forks</li>
<li>30 spoons</li>
<li>30 knives</li>
<li>30 cloth napkins</li>
</ul>
<p>Is that not a thing of beauty? She&#39;s included tips on the most efficient washing method (dishwasher), and spot treating the cloth napkins. There&#39;s a checklist so you can inventory after your fete, and return it all in ship-shape condition.&#0160;</p><p>I feel like I still have a mountain of prep to get ready for Sunday&#39;s party, but this aspect is taken care of in style. Durable party kits rock! Well done, Christy.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val=""/>
                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The President&#39;s Cancer Panel is made up of three&#0160;medical doctors&#0160;who are&#0160;experts in the field of oncology. They are about as mainstream medical as you can get. Their job (in a nutshell) is to&#0160;assess the current cancer climate in the US and make recommendations to the President about how to handle it. Last week <a href="http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/pcp.htm" target="_blank">the panel released its annual report (for 2008-09)</a>, which was focused on environmental risks, namely chemicals. It&#39;s a stunner. The panel blames lax regulation for the fact that we&#39;re all walking around with hundreds of chemicals in our bloodstream manifesting in increased cancer risks. Here&#39;s&#0160;a quote from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/opinion/06kristof.html" target="_blank">NY Times columnist Nicholas Kristof</a> on the subject of the panel&#39;s report:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>Noting that 300 contaminants have been detected in umbilical cord blood of newborn babies, the study warns that: “to a disturbing extent, babies are born ‘pre-polluted.’</p></blockquote>
<p>(I highly recommend reading his op-ed on the study.)</p>
<p>(Did you know that there are over 80,000 chemicals used in the US and only a few hundred have been tested for safety?)</p>
<p>I think what is so stunning about the study is that for so long environmentalists have been pooh-poohed for raising alarms over toxins and chemicals. Now here&#39;s a panel of doctors (two of which were appointed by George W. Bush) telling us we should be: </p>
<ul>
<li>eating organic foods and free-range meats&#0160;whenever possible </li>
<li>avoiding BPA and phthalates and drinking water from glass, stainless steel or safe plastic containers </li>
<li>not microwaving foods in plastic containers </li>
<li>filtering tap water </li>
<li>avoiding toys and foods containing endocrine disrupters</li>
<li>using databases like <span style="text-decoration: line-through">The Household Products Database</span> (No way. It sucks.&#0160;Use the <a href="http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/" target="_blank">Cosmetics Database</a> and the <a href="http://www.goodguide.com/" target="_blank">Good Guide</a>.) to research common products</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all stuff that the green movement has been advocating for years, so for this to be directly linked to cancer by this mainstream panel is huge. But what will ultimately become of it? Right now it&#39;s up to the individual to make informed choices (which typically involves a lot of research). When will the responsibility be placed on manufacturers? Will we ever see stricter regulation, or will the deep pockets of industry and lobbyists continue to beat it down? </p>
<p>The panel stresses that children, in particular, should be shielded as much as possible from toxins:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><font size="2">An analysis by the National Academy of Science found that children are particularly vulnerable to environmental contaminants for several reasons. Due to their smaller size, children’s exposures to toxics are disproportionately large compared with adults. Because their metabolic pathways are immature (particularly during fetal development and in the first months after birth), they are slower to metabolize, detoxify, and excrete many environmental chemicals. As a result, toxins remain active in their bodies for a longer period of time than would be the case in adults. </font></p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><font size="2">So, what do we do? Make the best decisions we can for our families based on the information available. Refer to books on the subject of toxins. (I find myself reaching for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KOTU8S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=readysetmomco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001KOTU8S">Healthy Child Healthy World</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="../../../../e/ir_t_readysetmomco-20_l_as2_o_1_a_B001KOTU8S.jpg" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; MARGIN: 0px; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none" width="1"/> when in doubt.) <a href="http://action.ewg.org/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=1888" target="_blank">Use the Environmental Working Group&#39;s form</a> to send a message to your Senators asking them to co-sponsor the Safe Chemicals Act. Pay attention. Demand reform. What else?</font></p><font size="2"><font size="2"></font></font>

                                For a while there, it seemed like everyone I knew was buzzing about <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/campaigns/jamies-food-revolution">Jamie Oliver&#39;s Food Revolution</a> tv show. My kids were dying to see the little snippet where he dressed up like a pea and ran around the school yard. My mom was watching. My husband even sat through a few episodes with me. <br/><br/>It seemed hard to believe it would ever happen, but he got that outspoken DJ Rod to come to his side. I also love that he finally made an ally out of ornery &#39;lunch lady&#39; Alice. In the last episode, schools workers, parents and others were all coming together. Jamie Oliver is just so likable&#0160; -- I rooted for him, and want him to be successful in Huntington, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Alabama</span> West Virginia and everywhere in the US! And then in a flash, the show was over. <br/><br/>Their website is optioning some star power, and gradually adding signers to the Food Revolution petition that Jamie Oliver will present to President Obama sometime this spring. I just hope this hasn&#39;t fallen off people&#39;s radars, you know? What with oil spills, and failed bomb attempts in New York City -- it&#39;s easy to get distracted from this important foundation for the future of our country&#39;s health. Just last week, the reports came out about <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100503/ap_on_he_me/us_med_childhood_obesity_states_3">childhood obesity</a> stats in the US. Mysteriously, Oregon seems better off than some states -- but overall, it&#39;s not pretty. <br/><br/>Please, folks. If you haven&#39;t already signed, do so. Encourage your spouse, mom, and friends to add their <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/campaigns/jamies-food-revolution/petition">vote for healthier school lunches for our kids</a>.&#0160;

I&#39;ll take a hand-drawn card wishing me a &#39;happy mothe&#39;s day&#39; or telling me that I&#39;m the &#39;beast mom&#39; over anything mass produced. Flowers? That hand-picked bunch of dandelions is as cherished as the supermarket bouquet my husband sometimes spontaneously brings home. I don&#39;t need anything fancier than that.<br/><br/>One of the best Mother&#39;s Day gifts ever was the video my husband made of our kids the year before our oldest went into kindergarten. He mixed in still photos and video, using iMovie. The kids spoke in voice-over (with loving prompts from my hub) about how much they love me, and all the fun things we do together. It&#39;s so beautiful and simple and sweet. And the memories! When I look back at it now, it&#39;s hard to believe they were ever so little. How babyish my young one sounds saying: &#39;Mama is my favorite friend.&#39; And my oldest (now 8) struggling at 5 to spell out the looooong word: M-O-T-H-E-R.<br/><br/>Some Mother&#39;s Days didn&#39;t involve gifts at all. Just special experiences like the one time my family made a favorite breakfast of French toast in bed. Or the year we picked that certain Sunday in May to kickoff gardening season, keeping our hands in the dirt all day. <br/><br/>Have any special Mother&#39;s Day memories or gifts to share? Please tell us about your best ones -- from both the giving and receiving points of view. <br/><br/>And from Heather and myself here at EnviroMom -- we wish our two wonderful moms a glorious mothe&#39;s day, because they&#39;re the beast!&#0160; Happy Mother&#39;s Day to all of you.

<p>We eat a ton of broccoli in this house. It&#39;s one of the few veggies my kids enjoy, and hub and I find it quite tasty indeed. What has killed me all of these years is paying for and then tossing the big old stalks in the compost. (Actually I chop them up before throwing in the compost so they break down faster.) I know you can buy just the broccoli crown in some grocery stores (though I never see this option at my New Seasons) but it also costs more. Recently I&#0160;came across&#0160;an <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/foodday/index.ssf/2010/04/florets_arent_broccolis_crowni.html" target="_blank">article in the Oregonian&#39;s FoodDay</a>, which has made me fall in love with broccoli all over again. You can eat the stalks! (Forehead slap.) Yes, just use a vegetable peeler to remove the hard exterior, chop it&#0160;and cook it however you typically cook broccoli. It has this mild, nutty flavor that three out of four broccoli lovers in my house enjoy. </p>
<p>We like to roast our broccoli, so here&#39;s what I do: remove the florets, peel the stalk and slice it into 1/4&quot; rounds. Toss everything in olive oil with some salt & pepper and roast in a pre-heated 425 degree oven for 8-10 minutes. Delish! <a href="http://livingthefrugallife.blogspot.com/2008/12/tiny-tips-broccoli-stalks.html" target="_blank">Living the Frugal Life</a>&#0160;likes to add stalks to fried rice, and she has some nice visuals of the whole process. And I just remembered that <a href="../../../../2009/10/enviromom-meatless-supper-club-week-5/">I&#39;ve made a yummy broccoli soup</a> that also uses the&#0160;stalks.</p>
<p>I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s these little things that can totally make my day.</p>

                                The Oregon Safe Routes to School promotes May as <a href="http://www.walknbike.org/walk-bike-challenge-month">Walk + Bike (to school) Challenge Month</a>. We usually participate by walking most mornings when the sun shines. On those rainy mornings, I&#39;m usually cursing the fact that I never really managed to get quality rain gear that fits the kids, and expected them to limp along in water repellent wind breakers and hope for the best. You&#39;ll also find me muttering under my breath: &#39;April showers bring May flowers… So quit raining already, and bring on the blooms!&#39; <br/><br/>Participating schools get cute little score cards where kids dig checking off the days they participate, by marking the appropriate icon: foot, bike or skateboard:<br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013480726799970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Walk-bike-scorecard" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e2013480726799970c image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013480726799970c-800wi.jpg" title="Walk-bike-scorecard"/></a> <br/> One of the goals of the program is to promote walking and biking for life. The brisk morning walk seems to wake up my kids&#39; brains. Mine too. <br/><br/>Of course, walking and biking is not just for kids. Here&#39;s a great little concept from Portland&#39;s bureau of transportation: <strong>The Transportation Pyramid</strong>! Just like the Food Pyramid, only better for you!! <br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133ed40db54970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Transportation-pyramid" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133ed40db54970b image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133ed40db54970b-800wi.jpg" title="Transportation-pyramid"/></a> <br/> Your car is like the fats and sweets -- use only once in a while! The bases? Walk + Bike! Get 5-9 servings each of those every day. OK, I just make that part up. Love it!! <br/><br/>One last thing while we&#39;re talking about healthy walking and biking stuff. Portland&#39;s got FIVE, count &#39;em, <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=46103">FIVE Sunday Parkways</a> events planned for this year, starting on May 16, and going through September. Keep your fingers crossed that the whole April showers thing will be done by May 16! Or just be tough like real Oregonians and bike/hike in the rain. We&#39;ve tested this a few times already this year, and have gotten caught in some downpours. Although our little girls are assuredly made of sugar and spice and everything nice, I&#39;m happy to report neither of them melted (or melted down!) in the rain.

Our dear friends at Kleenex want you to think that you NEED protection from nasty cloth towels that, heck!, everyone in your family uses.&#0160;Shudder. Think about it: you&#39;ve all dried your CLEAN HANDS on the SAME TOWEL. What are you, savages?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s their pitch:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>People in the U.S. dry their hands on cloth bathroom towels approximately 200 billion times a year. The CDC guidelines for hand washing recommends hand drying with a single-use towel. Families have not had a practical alternative to traditional cloth hand towels in their home bathrooms… until now.</p></blockquote>
<p>I...there&#39;s so much...I mean...when did...what?</p>
<p>I hopped on over to the CDC Web site, and lo and behold, as part of their <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cleanhands/" target="_blank">&#39;Clean Hands Save Lives</a>!&#39; campaign (inspired by H1N1)&#0160;they do, in broad, generalized terms,&#0160;recommend drying your hands with a paper towel or air dryer to prevent spreading germs.&#0160;In public settings, yes, of course this makes sense. However, no where does the CDC&#0160;actually caution you to avoid <em>evil cloth towels in your own home</em>.&#0160;Puh-lease. I was happy to discover that the <a href="http://goodgreenwitch.blogspot.com/2010/04/whats-next-disposable-bath-towels.html" target="_blank">Good Green Witch</a>&#0160;(equally pissed) actually contacted the CDC about this Kleenex claim and was called back by a real live CDC doctor, who indicated there were no CDC guidelines for home hand drying and would investigate further. Good for you Green Witch!</p>
<p>This is just another mind game developed by a <a href="http://www.kimberly-clark.com/" target="_blank">big old corporation</a> who wants to cash in on all the germ fears created by big old corporations -- antibacterial soap, disposable cleaning wipes, yadda. In doing so they are destroying our environment&#0160;with tree-killing, greenhouse gas emission-spewing, landfill-populating disinfecting products (that actually make germs stronger)&#0160;that generate&#0160;the &#39;need&#39; for more inane products. I&#39;m telling you, don&#39;t be surprised when Pampers starts pimping disposable underpants for your potty-trained kids (and adults!) because what could be more germy than underpants?&#0160;Old-fashioned laundering is simply too primitive and cannot possibly eliminate the germs that lurk on every item we touch, particularly those skid-mark-ridden Hello Kitty size fives.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>
