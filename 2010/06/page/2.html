<p>I don&#39;t have a parenting roadmap. For the most part I&#39;ve just tried my hardest to role model and make sure my kids know they are loved and supported. But the tween and teen years are not too far down the road, and I know that stuff starts to change for these innocent young &#39;uns. Media influences, peers, hormones, school pressure, dating -- all this messy stuff that makes me long for a&#0160;stunted-growth machine that can freeze their ages at 5 and 8 for a few more years. Thankfully, I think I&#39;ve found a way to make the aging process less scary:&#0160;a locally-based, self-directed parenting discussion group.</p>
<p>Maybe there are lots of these around the country, but here in my neck of the woods these groups are ramping up in popularity. I&#39;ve just started meeting with a boys parenting discussion group, and I&#39;m already hooked and feeling very excited about future meetings. Here&#39;s how it works: </p>
<p>You find 10-12 parents of boys (or girls) from your community who want to be in the discussion group. You decide how often to meet (once a month in our case) and where to meet (preferably out of hearing range of children), like in a church or library meeting room. Each parent has purchased a discussion guide and they read one chapter, which is discussed at the next meeting. <a href="http://www.family-empower.com/" target="_blank">The discussion guide we&#39;re using</a> (don&#39;t be turned off by the infomercial feel of this Web site; the guides are quite good) was compiled by a local parenting coach and is chock full of articles by parenting experts and includes questions/exercises for the group to discuss. Each chapter covers a specific theme, like media, personal development, safety, etc. We talk about our own personal challenges and learn about how other parents are dealing with various issues and provide support for one another. We also take an &#39;oath&#39; of confidentiality. </p>
<p>What I love about this self-directed model is that you are pulling from your immediate community and&#0160;working together with parents who likely have similar values. (You can also hand-pick who to invite.) Two of my neighbors are in this group, as well as parents from our school and friends of friends. These are people I&#39;ll see on walks, at the grocery store, at school -- people who will be in my life in some capacity&#0160;for many years to come.&#0160;We meet in a location that is close and convenient and conducive to car-pooling, at a time that works for all.&#0160;We&#39;ll be&#0160;building a small network of local support over the course of year, which is how long our boys group will meet, and (hopefully) developing tools to help&#0160;us raise healthy, happy boys. Hooray!</p>
<p>Have you participated in something similar? Are these groups gaining popularity in your community? The guide we&#39;re using (which is&#0160;best for parents of&#0160;elementary&#0160;and middle school-aged kids)&#0160;is not regionally-focused, so anyone from anywhere could use it. Start your own!</p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val=""/>
                        <div class="entry-body">
                                As part of the <a href="../../../../2010/04/super-excited-about-solar-check-out-solarize-southwest/">Solarize Southwest Portland project</a>, I signed up for a home energy review sometime in the past, such that I really didn&#39;t remember that I&#39;d done so and was a bit surprised when the folks at Energy Trust of Oregon called with a sudden opening, and asked if they could come over right away. I was home, so agreed, and then had to scramble to pick up all the dirty socks, etc. <br/><br/>Great service! You might think that an EnviroMom would have all this stuff down, right? Um, ha! I do have the thought cross my mind about low-flow shower heads just about every time I take a shower, but then by the time I&#39;ve toweled off and gotten dressed, that thought is gone and won&#39;t return until the next shower. Same deal with CFLs. Oh yeah. I&#39;ve heard the technology has improved. But I still curse some of the ones I have that seem to take 3 hours to fully warm up. Heck, I even had to revert back to one incandescent flood light in my kitchen because the long, dark winter and spring were killing me. Waiting for those CFLs to light up? I sometimes found myself curled up asleep on the kitchen floor, wondering why the coffee wasn&#39;t made yet. Sink faucet aerators? Truth be told, the thought never crossed my mind. In some ways, this can be blamed on denial. Our bathrooms had all been remodeled in that last 10 years. How bad could any of our stuff be? Well, apparently, bad enough. The great guy from Energy Trust replaced every shower head, every sink faucet aerator, and replaced 10 incandescent bulbs with LIghtwiz CFLs (and these ones are much better). Oh, and did I mention that it was all free? Score!<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f0ee02b3970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Sink-aerator" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f0ee02b3970b image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f0ee02b3970b-800wi.jpg" title="Sink-aerator"/></a> <br/> All told, here&#39;s what I learned:<br/><ul>
<li>Some of the stuff I had in my brain about CFLs was old data. They can now be used in &#39;closed&#39; light fixtures. Originally, that was not recommended. There are also now dimmable ones, which I&#39;ll check into. </li>
<li>Not only will the shower heads and sink aerators save water, but they&#39;ll also save energy when running hot, as less water gets heated. Never thought about that. </li>
<li>It behooves you to find out your fridge&#39;s birthday. I was told that 1993 and 2003 were big years for improved refrigerator efficiency. Turns out ours is from… 1992. Wah. While I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll go out and buy a new refrigerator in the next couple of days, it was helpful to learn that ours is likely fairly inefficient and that if we start saving for a new one, it&#39;d be better to replace it sooner rather than later. </li>
<li>They left me a form outlining &#39;opportunities&#39; to save, which include things like having more insulation and sealing done. </li>
<li>There was also a nice booklet explaining the cash incentives available for home energy improvements. </li>
</ul>
Have you had a home energy review done recently? Do other states offer this kind of fantastic program?

                                <p>I&#39;ve become a bit disillusioned with the whole&#0160;modern medicine&#0160;experience lately and have been thinking a lot&#0160; about seeing a naturopath. Typically I go to see my doctor, who is a very nice person,&#0160;when something is wrong. This happens maybe 2-3 times a year, mostly&#0160;for stuff like&#0160;sinus infections. She never seems to remember me, and that&#39;s been okay because I&#39;ve always been focused on getting drugs to relieve my misery. Get me in and get me out with a prescription in hand!</p>
<p>My big &#39;grrrrr&#39; moment came a couple of months ago when I went to see a dermatologist (on the recommendation of my doctor) for some red bumps around my eyes. He spent&#0160;three minutes with me.&#0160;Three minutes! &quot;It&#39;s rosacea. We don&#39;t know what causes it and there&#39;s no cure. So take this antibiotic and use this cream for two months and then come back.&quot; That was it! So I did that for a few weeks, and then I just got pissed. This is ridiculous. I don&#39;t want to just take drugs anymore to treat a problem. I want to prevent problems from happening in the first place! And my&#0160;understanding of naturopathic medicine is that the whole person is considered --&#0160;diet, lifestyle, exercise, environment&#0160;-- so that our bodies have the best opportunity to fight disease and sickness naturally, with added homeopathic remedies where necessary. I think I&#39;ve finally reached the point in my life where I&#39;m willing to make changes and explore alternatives to live the healthiest, happiest life possible.</p>
<p>Can naturopathic medicine do that? (No doubt we&#39;ll hear from some ND&#39;s who say, &quot;hell, yes!&quot;)</p>
<p>But I&#39;d&#0160;really like to hear from people who&#39;ve switched over to naturopathic doctors and how the experience has been for you. Do you get sick less? Do you feel you receive better care? Have you been able to resolve health issues through lifestyle or homeopathic treatments? Do you see both an ND and an MD, or have you completely abandoned the AMA? Or did you try naturopathy and go back to modern medicine? So many questions! </p>

                                I had my doubts about St. Barnabas. For the simple fact that they gave equal billing to the words &#39;rummage sale&#39; and &#39;craft boutique&#39; in their ads. A church or school rummage sale? That&#39;s my version of nirvana. Craft bazaar/boutique? Um, not so much. But what&#39;s an EnviroMom to do? When I found out St. Clare, my true love of rummage sales, was not having their sale this year, I despaired. At that one sale, I&#39;ve managed to exorcise a year&#39;s worth of retail therapy on a mere 30 clams worth of reuse treasures. So I had to find a substitute.<br/><br/>And here&#39;s what St. Barnabas had to offer… Stainless steel pot with colander, in great condition: $10.<br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013483a376f8970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> <br/> Cast iron skillet that looks just like the one my mom has used since forever: $8. <br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f079f611970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cast-iron-fryer" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f079f611970b image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f079f611970b-800wi.jpg" title="Cast-iron-fryer"/></a> <br/> I was pretty pleased at this point. But then I found this vintage food mill in fantastic condition for (wait for it): 10 cents. I&#39;m pretty sure I let out a fairly inelegant squeal of joy when I added that to my pile. <br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2013483a37918970c-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> <br/> The only challenge was that I&#39;d walked to the sale after helping at my kids&#39; school, and didn&#39;t anticipate such heavy items. You can understand why I passed on the canning jars. I was quite the bag lady clanking home (uphill!) in the rain (really!) with my pots and pans. I&#39;m starting to think vigorous walking with a cast iron frying pan may become one of the next hot exercise trends. Feel the burn! <br/><br/>St. Barnabas was so good on Friday, that I came back the next day with my family. We came home with Clue for 50 cents, and this vintage magnetic travel Pacheezy for 25 cents. Oh, and an old butcher block cutting board for 25 cents (another
candidate for crazy, wild up-the-intensity workout factor on your walk
home). The less said about the Barbie home karaoke machine my youngest picked for 50 cents, the better. <br/>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f079f995970b-pi" style="display: inline;"></a> <br/> Is there any lesson here? Be not afraid of the words &#39;craft bazaar.&#39; Fantastic treasure may still lurk. Rummage sale season is hereby kicked off. Let the reuse shopping begin! Oh, and just for fun, share your best rummage sale bargain ever.

<p>Play (verb): to engage in sport or recreation</p>
<p>Recreation (noun): an activity that diverts or amuses or stimulates</p>
<p>The importance of play for children is something we hear a lot about: getting them away from the screen and&#0160;finding unstructured&#0160;ways for them to explore their imaginations and be active.&#0160;But what about adults? Isn&#39;t it just as important for us grown-ups to get away from our responsibilities&#0160;and do something for the pure enjoyment of it?&#0160;Doncha think?&#0160;It&#39;s something that&#39;s easy for us to put aside, though, when you&#39;ve got piles of dirty laundry and a shopping list and (gasp) a job and people who are depending on you. Who has time to play?</p>
<p>It&#39;s a concept that I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot lately. I am a much happier person when I&#39;m able to get out of this house and do something for pure enjoyment. That could be a spontaneous walk with a neighbor or meeting some friends for coffee. It rejuvenates me, makes me laugh, makes me better appreciate what I have in my life and helps me deal with stress. A couple of weekends ago I spontaneously suggested that&#0160;our family&#0160;go to the local community center pool for open swim. Did I want to put on a swimming suit? No way. But dang we had fun that afternoon, throwing beach balls around and going down the slide. More, more, more!</p>
<p>My husband and I like to reminisce, &quot;Remember when, before kids, we used to play tennis in the evening? Good times.&quot; There&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t still do this! Let&#39;s get those kids some rackets (rummage sale!) and head to the courts! Or go shoot hoops, even though I suck. Uno, anyone?</p>
<p>There are <em>always</em> opportunities for play, it&#39;s just recognizing them and acting on them. I love hearing how other&#0160;adults and families play together. Do you take time for it? How do you play? Let&#39;s inspire each other to have some fun!</p>

Yes, my youngest child has hit the minimum requirements to bump up from a 5-point harness &#39;baby&#39; car seat (as she disparagingly calls it) to a big girl booster. So I have a car seat that is too old to pass on, ready to be recycled. Good bye, old plaid seat. Time for you to learn about the 3 R&#39;s!</p><p>Thankfully, here in America&#39;s greenest city, Portland, Oregon, Legacy Health has recognized that most people want to do the right thing:</p><ul>
<li>Retire car seats that are expired (ensures the ones in use are up-to-code and safe)</li>
<li>Gives car seat users an environmentally responsible way to recycle the plastic, metal and hard foam components</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past, Legacy has hosted many a car seat fitting clinic and health events where they collected expired car seats. Now, they have changed a few things:</p><ul>
<li>They ask that the owners take apart the car seats in advance, removing the fabric, harness webbing, soft foam, and mixed plastic/metal components. The metal and paper components can be recycled via regular curbside recycling programs. Legacy Health will recycle the hard plastic and hard foam parts. Thank goodness, because that would entirely mess up my <a href="../../../../join-enviromoms-one-can-a/">one garbage can a month</a> system if I had to pitch it!</li>
<li>They also have established regular drop-off points and drop-off times, as explained in a handy-dandy PDF outlining the car seat recycling guidelines. It also includes some illustrative photos of taking apart the seat to ready it for recycling. I am not going to list the drop off sites and times here, as those can change. So instead, I will link to <a href="http://www.legacyhealth.org/documents/Patient%20Education/Car%20Safety%20Seat%20recycling.pdf">Legacy Health&#39;s PDF of car seat recycling guidelines for Portland Metro</a> on their web site, as I know they will keep it up-to-date. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, of course, old plaid doesn&#39;t have to go away entirely. Heck, I could make some lunch-box napkins out of that familiar old seat cover!! That&#39;d drive my daughter so crazy, that I just might have to do it. </p>

                                <p>I took this picture of our little front yard garden plot several weeks ago when the sun made a brief appearance:</p><p>
<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f0014fa0970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Garden" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f0014fa0970b image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f0014fa0970b-800wi.jpg" title="Garden"/></a> <br/> Since then we&#39;ve have record breaking rainfall. You remember the opening pages of &#39;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cat-Hat-Dr-Seuss/dp/039480001X#reader_039480001X">The Cat and the Hat</a>&#39; book where the kids have their noses pressed to the rainy window? That&#39;s what it&#39;s been like here. Day in. Day out. I keep waiting for that crazy Cat in the Hat to show up and create some chaos. Nothing would surprise me. </p><p>Back to my garden. Near the trellis? Those are peas. Weeks later, they still look the same. If you have a microscope, you might see some tiny spinach, lettuce and carrots sprouting. But unless I can find a massive set of the world&#39;s tiniest water wings, everything is just gonna drown. Sheesh.</p><p>Tomatoes? Pathetic. Still in their little peat pots on the kitchen window sill. Basil and cilantro? Ditto. Inside, annoyingly breeding little flying bugs. Those <a href="../../../../2010/03/spring-gardening-and-sunflower-project-great-for-kids/">Lemon Queen sunflowers</a>? Stubbornly refusing to sprout. </p><p>I keep reminding myself that we won&#39;t starve if nothing in our garden grows this year. But it&#39;s frustrating. I&#39;ve been hearing this from a lot of my gardening pals. I hear ya! I empathize! This rain sucks.&#0160;</p><p>OK. Pity party is now over. If any experienced and/or level-headed gardeners would like to share any tips for making it through a soggy, boggy, exceedingly long wet spring -- please share. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val=""/>
                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Yesterday morning, in what I believe was a moment of fate, I switched on the TV for a moment and caught Mark Bittman&#39;s cooking segment&#0160;on the Today Show. Bittman is a personal hero of mine, and <a href="../../../../2009/10/envirobits-swedish-labeling-bpa-in-canning-lids-and-my-love-for-mark-bittman_p_2/">I&#39;ve sung his praises in the past</a>. He&#39;s a believer, much like another hero, Michael Pollan, in a diet that emphasizes plants, not meat. So here he was on the Today Show talking about how you can feed a family of four using just 1/2 pound of meat, treating meat like a condiment. The segment&#39;s&#0160;spin was purely focused on saving&#0160;money, but I know Bittman was also secretly relaying his own less-meat-more-veg values.</p>
<p>Raising meat the industrial way is terrible for the environment, the animals and our health. (See: <a href="http://www.foodincmovie.com/" target="_blank">Food, Inc</a>.) Raising pastured, organic, free-range meat is&#0160;much better&#0160;for the environment, the animals and our health, but it&#39;s not sustainable at the current levels of America&#39;s meat consumption, which is&#0160;200 pounds per person per year or 1/2 pound per day. So a good alternative is to eat&#0160;the&#0160;drug-free meat, but eat less of it.</p>
<p>The Today Show hosts had serious doubts (surprise, surprise) about Bittman&#39;s recipes&#0160;-- whether they&#39;d be filling enough -- so I tested one out last night.&#0160;I made his <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37456260/ns/today-today_food_and_wine/" target="_blank">Stir-Fried Vegetables with Ground Chicken in Lettuce Wraps</a> except I used ground pork and did not use lettuce wraps. (More on what I subbed down below.) I pretty much followed the recipe exactly as listed, though maybe not so much on veggie measurements. I just sliced and peeled until it looked like I had enough for my family.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133efafb2ec970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="Vegstirfrylittlemeat001" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133efafb2ec970b image-full " src="../../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133efafb2ec970b-800wi.jpg" title="Vegstirfrylittlemeat001"/></a> <br/></p>
<p>This recipe got major thumbs up from everyone. Yes, even the children. Yes, even the picky one.</p>
<p>We&#39;re talking cabbage, carrots, garlic, mushrooms (shitake not necessary, button or crimini&#0160;are fine), red onion (instead of scallion, for me), ginger, 1/2 pound of ground meat, soy sauce/tamari, stock or white wine (the latter, for me), a little sugar, salt & pepper. Crushed peanuts for garnish, if you like. Prepared just like he described in the link above. Delish. Flavorful. Filling. The perfect amount for a family of four, though if I had two teenage boys I&#0160;might have doubled the veggies. This is like an $8 dollar dinner, $2 per person.</p>
<p>This dish would be great over a little brown rice. We&#39;re experimenting with a low-carb diet over here, so I cut long ribbons of a zucchini with a vegetable peeler and sauted them in olive oil, salt & pepper for two minutes. For us, it&#39;s kind of like noodles. So good. I&#39;m sure the lettuce wraps would have been tasty, too.</p>
<p>Yes, America, it&#39;s possible to feed a family of four on 1/2 pound of meat. Listen to Bittman. Give it a try.</p>
<p>PS: I realize that most of America is not reading this blog and that I&#39;m speaking to a bunch of people who pretty much get it. But still, it&#39;s good to revisit this once in awhile.</p>

She works with fresh produce grown in the school&#39;s garden. There&#39;s a garden coordinator. The school has a full-time PE teacher. They speak in terms of a &#39;full-circle wellness program.&#39; It is heaven on a stick, if heaven were a kabob. Which is probably something they&#39;d have on the menu, which really includes such delicious sounding dishes as chicken panang curry and falafel with cucumber raita. Hoffman will be at the White House on Friday to take part in the launch of Michelle Obama&#39;s Chefs Move to Schools program, part of her overall <a href="../../../../2010/03/enviromom-supports-lets-move-campaign/">Let&#39;s Move campaign</a>. <br/><br/>Everything about the Abernethy program seems right. The locally grown, cooked-from-scratch food. The working kitchen! A school curriculum that is integrated with the garden. The garden itself, that is funded by the PTA. The chef that is well trained and paid a decent wage (let&#39;s hope). And it&#39;s all so different from the majority of the other schools in the district. And I cringe to say, but guess, the rest of the nation.<br/><br/>Here in the non-test world, we have heat and serve kitchens. With no dishwashers, so that a serving spoon has to be driven to a central processing facility to get washed. As sick as that sounds, I&#39;m not kidding. I wish I was making that up. We&#39;ve had proposals for school gardens, and we did have one in the past, but the reality is that test scores and the never-ending need to fund raise take up the majority of our school&#39;s and PTA&#39;s time. And the funding. As much as Abernethy seems like the ideal, if you can&#39;t get it to pay for itself and scale out to all the schools, then it&#39;s just dreaming. <br/><br/>I just wrote and deleted a paragraph bemoaning the state of public school funding. Thinking about it just makes me want to jump off a cliff (well, not really, but it does make me super depressed since we are in our annual school funding crisis mode where all the potential cuts sound awful). But I&#39;m not going there! We&#39;re going to hang onto the audacity of hope! A local school test kitchen chef is going to the White House. We have an administration and a First Lady who care about the health of our nation&#39;s kids. I&#39;m hopeful. Knock &#39;em dead, Chef Nicole!! Let&#39;s find a way to scale and fund it.
