					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2010/09/brazilian-blowout-contains-formaldehyde/">Brazilian Blowout contains formaldehyde. Enough said.</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				I realize that talking about the <a href="http://brazilianblowout.com/" target="_blank">Brazilian Blowout process</a> probably doesn&#39;t affect the majority of our readers, but maybe you know someone who has it done or were thinking about it for yourself. Well, stop it. This salon process is extremely popular -- it turns curly, frizzy hair into a straight, sleek, sexy mane. I&#39;ve seen the results first-hand, and they are spectacular. (It also costs between $200-$500. Very popular in Hollywood.) And I do understand how great hair can have a great impact on self-esteem. But is it worth the price? Read on.<br/><br/>Several months ago while I was sitting in my stylist&#39;s chair at the Platform Artistic Salon, she started telling me about the Brazilian Blowout and how every time it was performed in the salon, she and other stylists and customers were having adverse reactions: pain in their lungs and throat, trouble breathing, headaches, spontaneous nosebleeds. One of the stylists (who you&#39;ll see in <a href="http://www.koinlocal6.com/content/news/topstories/story/Popular-hair-product-responds-to-KOIN-Local-6/zcRQGB5VAki78XGQ03oUow.cspx" target="_blank">this KOIN video news report</a> -- watch it please) did some research and found that the product contained an ingredient from the formaldehyde family and started speaking out about it. So the salon limited the process to Sundays, when other customers weren&#39;t in the building. Not long after, the Brazilian Blowout company announced on its Web site that it was now &#39;hyde-free&#39; stating:<br/><blockquote><p>The Brazilian Blowout smooths the hair through the use of a proprietary polymer system that bonds amino acids to the surface of the hair.&#0160; This treatment is 100% salon safe. What makes the Brazilian Blowout treatment effective is our use of the Super Nutrient Complex in conjunction with a proprietary polymer system. This combination is what rounds the follicle, smooths the cuticle and repairs any preexisting damage.</p></blockquote><p>Sounds wholesome, doesn&#39;t it? So carefully worded? Let&#39;s throw in &#39;Super Nutrient Complex&#39; to give one the illusion of vitamins and minerals dancing through your hair!</p><p>So the salon took it to Oregon Health Sciences University, which tested two boxes of the product and <a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/croet/emerging-issues-and-alerts.cfm" target="_blank">found that they contained more than 10% formaldehyde</a>. Formaldehyde is a hazardous chemical, and in June the <a href="http://katysexposure.wordpress.com/2010/06/09/epa-formaldehyde-can-cause-cancer/" target="_blank">EPA concluded that it is carcinogenic when inhaled by humans</a>. (Remember the discarded FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina?) <a href="http://www.jtbaker.com/msds/englishhtml/f5522.htm" target="_blank">Formaldehyde comes with a slew of usage warnings</a>, including &#39;keep away from heat.&#39; In the BB process you apply constant heat to the hair with a straightener to make it sleek and shiny. Not a good combo. Everything, EVERYTHING, about this is just bad and wrong and needs to stop. My salon no longer offers the process. (Thank you, even though I was never there when it was being administered.)</p><p><strong>Brazilian Blowout is, of course, <a href="http://www.brazilianblowout.com/new-press" target="_blank">disputing the claims</a>.</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.womensvoices.org/" target="_blank">Women&#39;s Voices for Earth</a> is speaking out, the <a href="http://nailsalonalliance.org/" target="_blank">National Healthy Salon Alliance</a> is speaking out, and so can you if you ever hear anyone talk about it or if you know your salon offers the process. The Safe Cosmetics Act of 2010 is coming up for a vote soon, and proponents are pushing for limits on chemicals in personal care products and full disclosure. You can follow the progress at <a href="http://www.safecosmetics.org/index" target="_blank">The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics</a> and <a href="http://www.saferchemicals.org/" target="_blank">Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families</a> (on Facebook, Twitter). Many thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/sian_i_am" target="_blank">Sian Wu</a> for the links to the KOIN and OHSU reports.</p><p></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4b46fa3970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Silly-bands" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4b46fa3970b image-full" src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4b46fa3970b-800wi.jpg" title="Silly-bands"/></a> <br/>Do you know why they call them <a href="http://www.sillybandz.com/" target="_self">Silly Bandz</a>? Well, because you&#39;d have to be silly to shell out 6 bucks for a small packet of animal-shaped rubber bands, for crying out loud! Silly is a pretty kind descriptor if you ask me. I&#39;ll violate one of the house rules and call them downright stupid.<br/><br/>On the week school started, I did not know what Silly Bandz were. A friend mentioned them over coffee, and how they&#39;d been banned already in New York schools. What seemed like moments later, my kids were feverishly trading them on the playground with their peers after soccer practice. Turns out one of my kids had gotten some as a perk for sitting through her dental cleaning. Who knew? <br/><br/>While they&#39;ve yet to be banned in our school, they are met with groans and moans from the teachers and parents alike. I&#39;d support a ban. I will also add them to the list of throw-away entertainments I deplore: balloons, party goody bags, party noisemakers, stickers, temporary tattoos, and kids&#39; meal prizes. <br/><br/>One mom friend says she was able to sway one of her kids away from these things early on, by explaining they are bad for the environment. Brain child of an Ohio company (Heather, girlfriend, you have your work cut out for you over there…) They are made in (you guessed it) China. Of silicone, or shall we say &#39;silly-cone&#39;? There&#39;s an unfounded internet rumor that they are made from, get this, recycled condoms!!. What I&#39;ve noticed so far is that Silly Bandz are super easy to break, lose (and find!). I&#39;ve found several among the bark chips on local playgrounds. So if I can find them, so can birds. Yet unlike the birds, I have no interest in eating them (especially if they really are made from recycled condoms!). But I imagine it&#39;s only a matter of time before Silly Bandz and their imitators start showing up in the stomachs of sea turtles, fish and birds. <br/><br/>My older daughter might be swayed by my friend&#39;s line of green thinking. After all, we&#39;ve been surrounding ourselves with the beauty and wonder of plant and animal &#39;<a href="../../2010/09/loving-life/" target="_self">Life</a>&#39; lately. But my younger kid? Not so much. She wants, wants, wants and doesn&#39;t have that kind of discernment yet. I will keep working on her. REDUCE, Reuse, Recycle and all that. Maybe some day it will sink in. But I do promise one thing. I won&#39;t be buying any new silly-cone rubber bands for my kids from here on out. Who&#39;s with me?</p>

<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4abed2b970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Playroom" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4abed2b970b image-full " src="../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133f4abed2b970b-800wi.jpg" title="Playroom"/></a> <br/><em>Trying to keep the playroom tidy.</em>&#0160;</p><p></p><p>As I prepared our house to go on the market I knew our biggest challenge would be storing our many toys and encouraging our kids to dial back on the playroom mess. There is nothing I love more than listening to my kids play imaginatively in the playroom, which is still their primary source of entertainment. Building large, elaborate play cities with blocks? Yes. Recreating the Trans-Siberian Railway through the entire family room? The bigger the better, I say! But when you are on constant alert for calls from realtors who want to show your house in an hour, these wonderful messes become a thorn for both mom and kids. So we stowed many of the toys, and the kids have learned to alter their play.</p><p>Amazingly, I&#39;ve heard few complaints. Drawing has been big. Online chess is a hit. Reading, writing stories and playing cards have taken the place of Littlest Pet Shops. How creative can you get with 1/4 as many Legos? Very, it turns out. It helps that we&#39;re busy with school, soccer and Kung Fu, and that the skateboard park is the new favorite destination on a dry day. Staying out of the house keeps it tidy. But living with fewer toys has been eye-opening for all of us. It really can be done.</p><p>A friend recently went through this same exercise when she and her family moved. She boxed up the toys, and when they moved she only unboxed a few. Her girls got some &#39;new&#39; Craigslist toys that they&#39;d long wanted. But lots and lots of the &#39;old&#39; toys stayed boxed and ultimately went away, forgotten. I love this strategy for reducing toys by introducing a few new-to-you toys as a distraction. (I think I want to do this with my clothes and books!)</p><p>Sure, our favorite toys will make a comeback. But I&#39;m already making lists of the ones that will likely find new homes. By the time we settle in to our new house (which could very well be smaller than our current home) we&#39;ll have leaner playroom. And that will be just fine.</p>

But all of us still feel that yearning for the couch-potato state after a jam-packed weekend of home work, soccer games, piano practice, cleaning the danged gutters, schlepping to the farmer&#39;s market, etc. <br/><br/>Enter the natural history series by the <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/life-the-series-videos/">Discovery Channel/BBC called Life</a> (we checked out the DVD series from our local library). Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, its 10 episodes have absolutely riveted us. The stories of the plants and animals they feature are truly amazing. Fish who climb up rock walls, with a little help from a waterfall. Insects who inflate their eyeballs like balloons. Humpback whales crooning for mates. Stunning and diverse plants climbing massive trees to find a patch of sun. Birds, butterflies, bees -- you name it. Although -- be warned. It is about life, and the struggle to bring forth the next generations. So be prepared with your &#39;Birds and the Bees Lecture: 101&#39; While there&#39;s no graphic intercourse shown, allusions to sex are frequent and my kids had a multitude of questions on the subject. <br/><br/>The footage of these videos is absolutely amazing. Each episode weaves together a story of geography, habitats, the species that inhabit and thrive there, the food they eat, and the struggle to procreate and survive. It is gorgeous, astounding and inspiring. We never fail to talk for days about the species we learned about in each episode. I can&#39;t recommend Life highly enough. <br/>

They are looking to buy land so that the school can become a full bio-immersion grade school, instead of just the year-round preschool/kindergarten and summer camps it does now. We received this email yesterday from Teacher Kelly, and hope that you can help:<br/><blockquote>The land that we are pursuing for our grades program has been purchased by a developer who is moving forward (quickly) with the city in order to build an 8 home subdivision which would be next years&#39; &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;.&#0160; The co-owner of the land has agreed to have a meeting with me tomorrow at 2:00 and is willing to consider selling to a buyer who &#39;has the money&#39;.&#0160; I told him that we can get the money, and we are going to talk business tomorrow.&#0160; <br/>We cannot do this alone!!!!<br/>If you want to see an outdoor farm school in Portland, please consider one or more of the following:<br/>1.&#0160; Please send prayers/wishes/meditations/intentions out tomorrow (Friday) around the 2 o&#39;clock hour.<br/>2.&#0160; Please send prayers/wishes/meditations/intentions out for money (lots of it).&#0160; Price to be negotiated tomorrow.<br/>3.&#0160; Please make sure to attend the next grades visioning meeting - even if it is the only one you attend.&#0160; We need the energy in order to conjure momentum.&#0160; We will most likely schedule an &#39;emergency&#39; meeting before the 3rd Wednesday of October (which is the next regularly scheduled meeting).<br/>4.&#0160; Please make a tax deductible financial donation to Mother Earth School for our land acquisition.<br/>5.&#0160; Please tell people about us!!&#0160; Encourage people to support a truly grassroots environmental movement for the next generation.<br/>Thank you!!<br/></blockquote>

				<p>I might be just a titch on edge lately. What with trying to sell the house (and keep it clean) and worrying about where we&#39;ll be living in a couple of months and, did I mention that my husband has already moved to Ohio to start his job? Oh yeah, and doing the solo-parenting gig. Thank goodness for my mom and some very good friends who are at the ready for angst-dumping and spontaneous lunch dates -- they are keeping me steady. However, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d appreciate a 3am phone call every night, as I lie in bed, my mind racing, wondering, anticipating, fretting. I need some sleep, people.</p><p>I know this is a temporary thing because I usually get eight solid hours of shuteye a night. I just need to get through this phase. It&#39;s not falling asleep that&#39;s the problem, it&#39;s <em>staying</em> asleep. I just realized I haven&#39;t been to my gym in a week, so I&#39;m fixing that today. I&#39;ve been kind of curious about <a href="http://www.melatoninfaq.com/" target="_blank">melatonin</a> as a sleep remedy, which I&#39;ve heard about for years but have never tried. I have a friend who goes to a Body Talk practitioner when he has trouble sleeping (and, hmm, I just so <a href="http://www.familybodytalk.com/index.html" target="_blank">happen to know one</a>). I&#39;d love to hear some other ideas for naturally lulling oneself into a sound sleep. How do you do it?</p>

				We at EnviroMom are opposed to aquatic life having substance abuse problems, which could very well happen if you flush drugs down the toilet.

You know how it goes. <br/><br/>Therefore, we do heartily encourage you to take advantage of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration&#39;s first national prescription drug event (whew! that&#39;s a mouthful!), coming up this Saturday, September 25. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/NTBI/NTBI-PUB.pub?_flowExecutionKey=_cD20A8919-EC7F-95DB-5476-14677A1C85F2_k5B4F0E76-B6CC-19B6-4FEF-588FE3117535">Click here to find a prescription drug take-back collection site near you</a> by searching on your Zip or CIty/State.

Yep, Mom! I wonder why she won&#39;t let us get our own dog? </em></p>
<p>Yesterday, reader Amy&#0160;left a comment&#0160;on the <a href="../../2010/08/the-majestic-plastic-bag-a-mockumentary/">plastic bag&#0160;mockumentary</a>&#0160;we posted a few weeks ago (check it out if you haven&#39;t seen it). The video and post encouraged folks to&#0160;support bans on plastic grocery bags and bring reusables instead. Amy&#0160;asked:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>My only problem with using less of these bags is what to use to scoop out the cat litter? I have definitely cut back on getting them all the time - especially at the grocery store, but I need a few of these suckers each week!</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, I remember the kitty litter box days of yore. Scoop, sift, dump, tie, toss quickly, wash hands. Plastic bags are definitely the preferred receptacle. Ditto dog waste. But when I look at the vast amount of plastic bags that come into my life, I can&#39;t imagine that the average person has any shortage of them. (But bravo if you do!) I use reusable cloth shopping bags, and I seldom ever take those flimsy plastic produce/bulk bags, so it&#39;s not about those.&#0160;It&#39;s the bread bags and newspaper bags and tortilla bags and other random plastic packaging bags. Seriously, we eat about three loaves of bread a week and get the newspaper seven days a week, which&#0160;adds&#0160;up to&#0160;a minimum of ten plastic bags per week. (I know, I know, I could bake my own bread and read the paper online, but this isn&#39;t really about me now, is it?) It&#39;s about the fact that it seems like most people have no shortage of plastic bags in their life because everything is so highly packaged.</p>
<p><strong>Sidebar: </strong>I know I&#39;ve ranted plenty about those &#39;biodegradable&#39; pet waste bags in the past. In summary: if a product is billed as &#39;biodegradable&#39; don&#39;t fall for that greenwash unless you are composting the item. If it&#39;s going to the landfill, the biodegradable qualities don&#39;t matter. A tremendous amount of energy and resources went into making that single-use pet poop bag. And if stuff is biodegrading in the landfill, then it is releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Boo. There is no virtue in spending money on biodegradable products that will end up in the landfill.</p>
<p>That said, I&#39;d like to hear what y&#39;all are using to&#0160;bag your pet poop. Especially you uber-greenies who eschew plastic and avoid those bags like the plague. Have you started a&#0160;plastic bag co-op? Are you begging for bags on Craigslist? Sneaking bags out of your neighbor&#39;s trash? Or just saving every cereal bag liner and getting creative with other types of packaging? Do tell.</p>

				Heather and I were chatting the other day, and I told her that I wished I was a person who rode her bike more often for little errands around the &#39;hood. But in reality, I&#39;m far more likely to jump into the car to pick up the groceries, and later have it dawn on me a half mile into my drive that I really could have taken my bike instead. <br/><br/>So here&#39;s a simple idea akin to the little reminders that help form the habit of bringing reusable shopping bags. Put a little kick in the pants in your driver&#39;s seat, and see if it motivates you to remember the <a href="../../2010/05/may-is-walk-bike-month-transportation-pyramid-portland-sunday-parkways/">transportation pyramid</a>. <br/><br/>

And see if I can cut down on the driving I do, and up the amount of bike trips and walks in my daily outings.
