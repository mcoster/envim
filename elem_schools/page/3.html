		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last week we talked a bit about the problematic styrofoam lunch trays that many schools are sending to the landfill every day, but frankly I&#39;m a bit more concerned about the stuff that&#39;s served on those trays. Here&#39;s the thing: the child nutrition programs, which include the nationwide school lunch program, will be coming up for renewal by Congress this spring. This only happens once every five years. According to <a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/campaign/time_for_lunch/" target="_blank">Slow Food International&#39;s Time for Lunch program</a>, the government reimburses schools $2.68 for every meal served to a child who qualifies for free lunch. After overhead expenses the schools really only have about $1 to spend on each lunch.&#0160;Have you&#0160;seen what $1 gets a kid for lunch? Blergh.&#0160;However, now that President Obama has declared a freeze on&#0160;domestic program funding, it seems really unclear whether necessary additional funding will be awarded, so maybe it&#39;s a moot point. (Or as Joey Tribbiani would say, a &#39;moo&#39; point.) But among healthy school lunch advocates,&#0160;hope remains that some additional funding will be granted.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here in Portland, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as bad as in other school districts (but it is far from great, and I only let my kids eat it once a week). Portland&#39;s kids have a fresh fruit and veggie bar, and occasionally some locally-sourced food,&#0160;in addition to the usual processed fare. But there is a <em>fascinating</em> blog by an anonymous teacher from Illinois&#0160;that you must check out if you feel strongly about school lunch. It&#39;s called <a href="http://fedupwithschoollunch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Fed Up with School Lunch</a>, and this teacher is eating, photographing&#0160;and blogging about the hot lunch served in her school every day in 2010 (or until she is outed and fired). The food is horrifying. </p>
<p>The sad thing is that 18 million children in the US qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and for many this is their only hot meal of the day. The typical hot lunch is massively over-processed and of dubious origin. It&#39;s the kind of food that is contributing to the rise of obesity and diabetes&#0160;in the US. (FYI: Oprah is doing a show on this epidemic today.) In December, USA Today released a report claiming that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-12-08-school-lunch-standards_N.htm" target="_blank">school lunch meat doesn&#39;t even meet the standards of many fast food chains</a>. Something is terribly wrong here.</p>
<p>What can you do? You aren&#39;t going to like it, but truly, contacting your&#0160;congresspeople is the best way to make reform happen. They need to hear that their constituents demand more money for healthier school lunches. An additional $1 per child could have a huge impact on the quality and source of food served in the schools. Actually, Slow Food is pushing for three specific changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the funding to give school lunch programs an additional $1 per child per day </li>
<li>Protect kids from the junk food sold in vending machines located in schools </li>
<li>Link schools to local farms to teach healthy eating. Guarantee $50 million for Farm to School programs.</li>
</ul>
I am sending a short, to-the-point message to my two US Senators and two Representatives because they need to hear from me. And you. You can find contact info at <a href="http://www.congress.org/" target="_blank">Congress.org</a> by entering your zip code. If you&#39;re really motivated, talk your&#0160;school principal and get her/his read on it, and see if you can organize a school-wide letter-writing campaign. THAT should send a message!

			<div class="entry-body">
				When neighboring school Bridlemile threw down the gauntlet to our school and others in the area to wash and collect this week&#39;s styrofoam lunch trays and bring them to the <a href="../../../2010/01/portland-curbside-composting-plus-styrofoam-recycling-news/">recycling event they&#39;re hosting this Saturday</a>, I was surprised that our school got the green light to participate, and shocked myself by volunteering to help wash (quickly followed by screaming inside my head: &#39;Holy cow! What&#39;s wrong with you? You just volunteering to do what??&#39;)<br/><br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20128771c1769970c-pi" style="float: right;"></a> After the first two days of washing, pretty much everyone on our school&#39;s green team is convinced this isn&#39;t really sustainable. The hot water necessary to wash the dreaded greasy ranch dressing (give me ketchup any day!) off a stack of 150 foam trays a day. Woe to the first day&#39;s volunteers (count our Heather among them) who operated under the misunderstanding that they had to dry the trays too and used (cringe) paper towels because they didn&#39;t know where the cloth towels were. The back-straining valuable time of a volunteer army leaning over a sprayer-less sink to get the job done. I don&#39;t know how Bridlemile does it every week (but kudos to them). Likely our school will do our best on this week&#39;s experiment/challenge then go back to throwing them away as usual, thankyouverymuch. You gotta pick your battles, right? <br/><br/>Truth be told, the work wasn&#39;t as hard as I thought it would be. I washed solo and brought my iPod and likely embarrassed myself thoroughly by singing out loud to <em>Hope for Haiti Now</em> had anyone near the kitchen overheard my caterwauling. I washed about 150 trays in 40 minutes. I&#39;ve got them bagged and ready for the foam recycling event this Saturday. Would I volunteer to do it again? Um. Don&#39;t think so.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I hate the disposable foam trays. It&#39;s one of those poster child issues. How can a green city like Portland and its biggest school district buy and throw away (hold onto your hat, here) 3.9 million of these trays a year? But all this effort (and water) to wash and recycle styrofoam seems fairly pointless when we should be <a href="../../../2008/07/one-can-a-month/">higher up in the Reduce/Reuse/Recycle hierarchy</a>. Let&#39;s find a way to invest in durable trays (my pick would be stainless steel, if anyone&#39;s interested) and use water/energy efficient dishwashing machines to clean them (not the tree-hugging parents who already volunteer in the classrooms, helping kids read and learn math). Or here&#39;s a crazy thought: kids who eat hot lunch would bring their own stainless steel tray each day, slip it in a waterproof envelope and wash at home. Bring back the next day: no clean tray, no lunch. Sorry. That&#39;s crazy talk. I got carried away. <br/><br/>When I did unplug from my iPod, I had an interesting chat with our school&#39;s custodian, who&#39;d much rather save the money spent on garbage from the voluminous daily milk cartons (that we used to be able to recycle, but now can&#39;t because they have to be rinsed, which we don&#39;t have the manpower for). The foam trays are so light and stackable, that they seem like a non-issue to him. <br/><br/>In any case, <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/news/2611.htm">Portland Public Schools district has recently announced the pilot of durable lunch trays may be expanding from 17 to 68 schools</a>. I hope they pick our school!! But I&#39;m not going to hold my breath since there seems to be issues about not having the water hookup necessary for a dishwasher onsite. <br/><br/>As for the foam tray challenge, the collection event is this Saturday. I&#39;ll let you know how that goes. Now what to do about these dishwater hands...

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				We&#39;ve just celebrated my first-born daughter&#39;s 8th birthday! Eighth! It seems so old, that I might as well be saying 80th! <br/><br/>First off -- thank you EnviroMom readers for the great classroom celebration idea! To avoid both the sugary treats and token giveaway at school, my young bookworm talked to her teacher about picking a book to donate to her class. We got a really nice young learners&#39; biography of Helen Keller, whom my daughter admires, and read a bit from it to celebrate with her class. Kudos also to her teacher who talked about how instead of bringing a treat that would be gone in the blink of an eye, we&#39;d brought something that the class could share and use forever! They also did a fun exercise where the students paired up and tried finger spelling on each others&#39; palms, demonstrating the first way Helen Keller learned words. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2012876d0baf0970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Hooperville" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e2012876d0baf0970c " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e2012876d0baf0970c-200wi.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 200px;"/></a> My daughter chose an experience party with her family instead of a friend party -- so we swam our hearts out last weekend at the local community center. As for her gifts, is there anything cooler than finding the perfect gift for someone that you know they are going to love? Just so you know, my 8-year-old has a knack for the hula-hoop. She learned it at one of her last summer camps and blew my socks off the first time she showed me. Trouble is we only have a very heavy and adult-size home-made hula hoop, which doesn&#39;t work well for what my daughter calls &#39;neckers&#39; (twirling the hoop around her neck). So check out this hoop of beauty...<br/><br/>It&#39;s a<a href="http://www.visithooperville.com/"> locally hand-made kid-size hula hoop by the Mayor of Hooperville, Portland-based Erika Fey</a>. Ha! And I feared my only hoop choices would be banged up second-hand (if I could find one in the right size) or mass-produced made in China. Not so! Hooray for Hooperville! Hooray for locally made gifts, books to share with school kids, experience parties and all manner of green birthdays!!<br/><br/>PS If you want to put some spring in your step, check out this <a href="http://www.visithooperville.com/video1.html">awesome video of the Mayor of Hooperville</a>… Makes me want to step into a hoop (but not look anything like the video) and totally make an utter fool of myself. But hey, it&#39;ll be fun!

Like last year&#39;s <em>very</em> successful experiment, she&#39;s once again <a href="../../../2008/11/the-no-party-birthday-party/">opted to forgo a&#0160;home or destination birthday party with friends</a> and chosen an &#39;adventure day&#39; with her family (we&#39;re going to the&#0160;Oregon Coast&#0160;Aquarium). So she wanted to make sure her friends were at least&#0160;aware that she was turning eight.&#0160;(Eight!?! Yowsa.)</p>
<p>I always know when there&#39;s a birthday party at school because my kids walk off the bus munching a cookie or cupcake or waving a small plastic toy in the air. This is the norm, and I can understand why parents continually choose to follow the norm. It&#39;s easier than coming up with an alternative, and perhaps they don&#39;t want their child to be perceived as different. I, on the other hand, love to rock the boat! And I think that a commercial-made (as required by the school district) sugary snack after six hours of school is never a good idea. I&#39;ve seen how it can turn a tired kiddo into a Tasmanian Devil. Ew.</p>
<p>So after a short discussion&#0160;my daughter&#0160;and I decided that a fun alternative to sugar and toys would be to play a classroom game. The teacher thought it was a fantastic idea, so she led the class in the classic Heads-Up 7-Up during the last 15 minutes of school one day. The kids loved the game.&#0160;My daughter got a birthday crown and everyone sang to her, and she was very happy. Recognized. The end.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, it&#39;s a&#0160;small gesture. But I feel like these little moments&#0160;provide opportunities to talk to my kids about what we value, and what&#39;s really important <em>in the grand scheme&#0160;of things</em>. I see them --&#0160;these&#0160;happy, vibrant children of mine --&#0160;&#39;getting it&#39;&#0160;and standing up for their (our)&#0160;choices. After the games were over a girl asked my daughter what I&#39;d brought for the class. &quot;We&#39;re just playing games today.&quot; &quot;But what did you bring?&quot; &quot;We brought fun! Didn&#39;t you have fun?&quot; Yes, yes she did.</p>

She is lead organizer of our elementary school&#39;s service club, and this year had the fantastic idea of using the teacher inservice days (when kids are out of school) to take the club to local service organizations and volunteer our time where they need it most. Last year, you may remember when I wrote about <a href="../../../2009/04/reuse-spiffing-up-used-board-books-for-kids-in-need/">cleaning up donated board books for the Children&#39;s Book Bank</a>. Another time our service club got together to make birthday kits, which we then donated to an organization that would get them to kids who might not otherwise have parties. Both activities taught our kids not only about volunteering and sharing their time, but to reuse things already on hand, and give creative new life to stuff if we bundle things in new ways. <br/><br/>Back to our most recent activity... A few weeks ago Friday, two groups of about 10 families from our elementary school went to the <a href="http://www.northwestchildrensoutreach.org/index.php">Northwest Children&#39;s Outreach</a>. We brought with us carloads of clothing, diapers, strollers, car seats, high chairs, cribs, toys, books, etc. Our family in particular brought four bags of clothing, shoes, coats, socks, books and what felt like the world&#39;s largest collection of well-loved My Little Pony toys. We took a short tour and learned about this organization, then we rolled up our sleeves and helped sort and organize the donations into kits that they in turn hand off to other service organizations. I was in a group comprised primarily of second graders who counted out diapers from big donated boxes, and repackaged in smaller amounts. We were stunned to hear that 1,000 diapers are donated and delivered to families from this organization each week. Each family&#39;s baby can only get 20 diapers, which gives an idea of the vast number of people this organization helps. <br/><br/>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a5e5b5ee970b-pi" style="FLOAT: left"></a> ***I did not intend to write a soapbox rant for <a href="http://www.blogactionday.org/" target="_blank">Blog Action Day</a>, but that in fact is what&#0160;this is. You know I don&#39;t usually rant, nor do I consider myself much of an activist. But now I just know too much, and I don&#39;t think we should take it anymore.***</em></p><a href="http://www.blogactionday.org/"></a><br/>
<p>Did you know that if your child gets hot lunch at school they are often&#0160;<em>required</em> to take a carton of milk even if they don&#39;t want to drink it? Unless your child brings in a doctor&#39;s note stating they are lactose-intolerant or allergic, many school districts&#0160;instruct their staff to tell children they&#0160;<em>must</em> take a carton of milk, which&#0160;the child then <em>throws&#0160;away unopened</em>.&#0160;(And nope, it can&#39;t go back into the cooler because the quality is compromised.) This&#0160;happens at my kids&#39; school, and I was made aware of it by a friend whose family&#0160;eats a vegan diet. It all goes back to the USDA, an&#0160;agency that firmly believes dairy is mandatory for a healthy diet (a claim I am just now <a href="http://www.gotohealth.com/articles/read.cfm?article_id=30" target="_blank">beginning to question</a>). In fact, the USDA reimburses schools for every serving of milk they pass out to students, which is why the schools push it. </p>
<p>Did you know that <a href="../../../publications/pubs/upload/NICHD_MM_Lactose_FS.pdf" target="_blank">30-50 million Americans (adults and children) are&#0160;lactose intolerant</a>? (That&#39;s 1 in 6 Americans.)&#0160;<a href="../../../publications/pubs/upload/NICHD_MM_Lactose_FS.pdf" target="_blank">How about this</a>:&#0160;70% of African Americans,&#0160;80% of Hispanics,&#0160;95% of Asians and 100% of Native Americans are lactose intolerant. So why is there such a big push by the USDA to force kids to take milk? Could it be because the USDA subsidizes big agriculture?</p>
<p>We all know that the American food system is totally messed up. The government subsidizes all of these pesticide-ridden, genetically-modified, hormone-filled monster farms in an effort to provide cheap (and often unhealthy)&#0160;food to the American people. Then they create a <a href="http://www.mypyramid.gov/index.html" target="_blank">food pyramid</a>, which tells people how they should be eating. (The &#39;Milk&#39; slice of the pyramid is the same size as the &#39;Vegetable&#39; slice, by the way.)</p>
<p>All of these big cattle farms, both for meat and dairy production, are taking a huge toll on the environment. I mentioned those startling statistics when we launched the <a href="../../../2009/09/its-time-for-a-meatless-supper-club/">Meatless Supper Club</a>: industrial livestock&#0160;production causes&#0160;more greenhouse gases than cars. All of the environmental problems caused by livestock are spelled out in this <a href="http://www.emagazine.com/view/?4264" target="_blank">excellent article from E Magazine</a>. The methane production, the cutting down of the rainforest for grazing land, the heavy fertilizer, pesticide and water use for growing cattle feed -- the list goes on and on. </p>
<p>Having said all of that, I&#39;ve been buying&#0160;1-2 gallons of organic milk each week for my family for years, because I&#39;ve always thought it was essential for good health. I&#39;ve got one milkaholic child, and I do love a glass of cold milk once a day. But I&#39;m ready to cut back on this, much in the same vein of serving more vegetarian meals to my family. A cow is a cow. I&#39;ve talked to my kids about why we&#39;re eating less meat, and I will talk to them about why we are drinking less milk. We can get our calcium needs met through many other foods. Milk is not required, and it should not be forced on children who can&#39;t drink it or don&#39;t want it.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a58ef1e1970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Veggie-face" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a58ef1e1970c image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a58ef1e1970c-800wi.jpg" title="Veggie-face"/></a> Theren&#39;s nothing I love better than a potluck dinner, and although I&#39;m not sure what side dish I&#39;m bringing to tonight&#39;s potluck, we&#39;re lucky to be in the abundant harvest season with heaps of local, organic produce coming out our ears. What&#39;s especially cool about tonight&#39;s potluck is that it&#39;s being hosted by one of the moms heading up the Green Team at a neighboring elementary school. We met randomly on a local playground this summer. This mom thought it would be a great idea if we all met and had an opportunity to get to know one another better. Socializing is always a good thing. With the added benefit of sharing knowledge so that each school doesn&#39;t have to reinvent the proverbial wheel. I&#39;ve been frustrated by how long it takes to get things done at school, and often I&#39;ll read something cool in the paper about what another school is doing -- and just like one of my kids, I&#39;ll be all: &#39;Hey! I want that! How do we do that? Gimme that NOW!&#39; As you can imagine, that approach is about as productive as when my kids try it. So you save the idea &#39;til the next meeting, bring it up, hopefully get some others fired up by it, and then do some research, and propose it to the principal or the district, then get some feedback about priorities and tight budgets, and ultimately get fairly depressed so you don&#39;t care anymore, and then it&#39;s the end of the year. Wow. Just call me Little Miss Sunshine! Gotta work on my attitude... </p><p>Couple of things our school&#39;s green team is focusing on for next year:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Reduce the ridiculous number of catalogs our school office receives.</strong> Sure we&#39;ve all done the <a href="http://www.catalogchoice.org/">Catalog Choice</a> stuff <em>at home</em>. Now it&#39;s time to do it for our school. This will be a volunteer-heavy quest. It takes almost forever for the aforementioned service to kick in, so it&#39;d probably be more effective to get a few parents to take stacks of catalogs, call the 800 numbers and get us off the mailing lists. High marks for easy, and if we make the calls, we should get off the lists fairly quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Increase usage of durable party kids in the classrooms.</strong> Last year, we tested the concept in one of the first grade classrooms. One parent put together a big tub of small durable plates, cups, spoons and cloth napkins. It was a hit. I believe it fell to the volunteer room parent to wash the stuff after a party, but it made a big dent the amount of trash the classroom was producing for celebrations. For next year, we are going to fundraise at our annual auction to provide more classroom durable kits. We are blessed with a generous, green-minded group of parents at our school. Hopefully, the auction will fund more durable kits and the class parents won&#39;t mind the added task of some occasional dishes and laundry. </li>
</ul>
<p>Back to our random playground chat... I shared these initiatives with the potluck hosting mom, and she was excited to try these projects at her school too, and especially if we would share what we learned to save them some work. Likewise, their school has made progress in the <a href="../../../2008/02/hip-hip-hooray/">styrofoam lunchtray war</a>, by setting up a process to recycle their trays. This continues to be our Waterloo, as our school have different challenges. But maybe we can learn something. Or figure out a more creative approach. They also hosted a styrofoam weekend recycling event. Which we&#39;d love to do. Anyhoo. Tonight&#39;s potluck should have parents representing a handful of neighboring schools. I&#39;ll let you know how it goes. Can&#39;t wait! Now, back to my side dish...</p><p>Do you network with neighboring green schools? What&#39;s the best green initiative your school has implemented? Send us an email, and we&#39;d be glad to feature it in a post. </p>

You know: the school letters. Not the ones that will tell us if our kids got into Stanford or anything. But who their teachers are for next year! Are we not a sad and somewhat pathetic bunch, that this obsesses us so? I swear. It&#39;s not just me. Every mom I know has talked about this for weeks: &#39;When are the letters going to come?&#39; &#39;Who do your kids want for their teacher?&#39; It really amazes me that we moms care so much when the kids are oblivious to it all and just basking in the joy of unstructured summer days. But it is what it is. We are pathetic. Enough said. </p><p>Along with the letters informing us who our kids&#39; teachers will be, we got the school supply lists. This is only our third year in public school, so the first year, I used the online ordering service provided by <a href="http://www.schoolhousesupplies.org/">Schoolhouse Supplies</a> -- a local nonprofit that takes office supply donations and gives them to teachers whose students are in need of pencils, paper, erasers, you name it. Great org, and on top of that fantastic service to teachers, they also put together packages of some local schools&#39; requested school supplies -- following the teachers&#39; list to a T -- to save us moms and dads the time, effort and money of comparison shopping and driving from store to store looking for just the right pink eraser that the teacher has requested. </p><p>

Not really a fundraiser. Just a fun blow-out for the end of the year. Pizza slices for sale. Bouncy houses. Duck pond. You know the drill. But a heck of a lot of fun. They did skip the always popular toss a pie in the face of your &#39;favorite&#39; teacher, which was a bit of a relief. As much as some kids like it, others feel sort of weird about how disrespectful it is. And it&#39;s a heck of a waste of whipped cream in a country that <a href="../../../2008/07/one-can-chall-3/">wastes far too much food</a> as it is!! Well, maybe not exactly cream. Food product. Lite non-dairy whipped topping? In any case, what fat it does have gets in the eyes of the teachers and they end up all blurry eyed for days. The above photo was taken last year of our beloved kindy teacher who took it all in stride and wisely wore swim googles. I guess we should be thankful it wasn&#39;t replaced with a dunk tank!! </p><p>Anyhoo. Back to the carnival. As part of our Green Team, we&#39;ve been selling stainless steel water bottles emblazoned with our school logo to promote reuse and drinking tap water. One of the parents ordered a bunch of them wholesale prior to our last auction, and while they have been a big seller, we&#39;ve still got a fair inventory, so we set up a table and sell them at picnics, carnivals, etc. Don&#39;t ask me the margin on &#39;em. I don&#39;t know. But it is cool to see how many folks bring their own bottles and filled up from the 5-gallon durable water containers we provided, or would choose to buy the $12 stainless steel bottle over the single-use water bottles for sale over at the concessions table. </p>

				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20115709f9c75970b-pi" style="float: right;"></a> Today is bittersweet. My youngest and Heather&#39;s graduated from preschool. Having put each of our two kids through the program, our families have been there for 4 years. If not for the preschool, it&#39;s uncertain if Heather and I would ever have become friends. It started with a hand-shake deal in a neighboring park that went something like this:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Heather</strong>: Hi, so, um, remember me? My daughter went to daycare with your friend Stacey&#39;s daughter? You <em>are</em> Renee, right?<br/><strong>Renee</strong>: Yes. Oh yeah. You&#39;re <em>that</em> Heather. So are you still working? <br/><strong>Heather</strong>: Nope, but I&#39;m thinking of doing a co-op preschool next year. What are you thinking? We could trade babysitting of our little ones on our help days. What do you think?<br/><strong>Renee</strong>: Are you crazy? I don&#39;t know you from Adam! Get away from me you looney!<br/></div><p>Well, that&#39;s not really what I said. I had a good feeling about <em>that</em> Heather, and it&#39;s worked out rather well. Some of it I won&#39;t miss. Four years is a long time. Cleaning that old church basement -- that with no amount of scrubbing ever really looked clean. But I am pleased to say that in the years we were there, it did become an <a href="http://www.oeconline.org/our-work/kidshealth/ehcc">OEC certified &#39;Eco-Healthy Childcare.&#39;</a> Not to take too much credit, as this was a process of many steps with many parents involved -- but I&#39;m pretty sure Heather was the first person to bring up the possibility to the preschool board.</p><p>In addition to the greening of the school, the preschool payoffs have been huge. We met a family that invited us (along with Heather&#39;s) on our first <a href="../../../2007/08/outdoor-kids-i-/">camping trips with kids</a>. Aside from the killer mosquitoes one summer, they were fabulous experiences -- that went a long way in encouraging our <a href="../../../enviromom/outdoor-kids/">Outdoor Kids efforts</a>. No question, our kids have become great friends, as have we. Heather and I? Gosh, she&#39;s like my other half, the sister I never had. We certainly wouldn&#39;t have started EnviroMom and gone on this green journey had we not become friends first via the preschool. I&#39;m pretty sure I would not have done any of this on my own. Having a best friend to cheer me on, teach me and laugh with me? And to give me the opportunity to do the same? We&#39;re lucky. Really lucky. Blessed. </p><p>Graduation Day? Call it &#39;Gratitude Day&#39; for me. After what seems like a million baby steps, I hardly recognize the person I was 4 years ago, before this green friendship started. I realize this preschool &#39;ending&#39; is really a beginning of something new. So I&#39;ll keep my <a href="../../../2008/12/nose-test-on-cloth-handerkerchiefs-and-paper-tissues-tp-etc/">hanky</a> handy, dab my happy tears, and embrace the green journey that lies ahead. Thank you children for putting up with the crazy ideas of your wacky EnviroMoms. Thank you Heather! And thank you readers for your presence, comments and support!&#0160;</p><p>Wishing everyone a wonderful Memorial Day weekend!!</p>
