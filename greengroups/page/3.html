					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2007/12/sw-greengroup-m/">SW GreenGroup Meeting Updates</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Our SW Portland GreenGroup met last Friday. We were glad to see a few new faces, as well as welcome back some we hadn't seen in a while.</p>
<p>I started off with my burning questions about <a href="../../../2007/12/old-socks-old-s/">what to do with old socks/undies, board books and stuffed animals</a>. In addition to the great comments from our readers, it was suggested that the Children's Relief Nursery and NW Children's Warehouse will take old stuffies and toys.</p>
<p>I also spoke a bit about the NOVA <em>Silence of the Bees</em> episode I recently watched. Basically, all fruits and veggies would go away if the honey bees stop doing what they're doing, i.e., pollinating on a mass scale. So do you like rice, wheat or corn? Yum! Gruel! That may be what we'll be eating in the future. Or else learning to hand pollinate like they do in a region of China that has permanently destroyed their honey bees. Scary stuff. It remains to be seen this winter if Colony Collapse Disorder continues in the US. Stay tuned...</p>
<p>Emily showed us a great little <a href="http://www.chicobag.com/">Chico Bag</a> she uses that bundles up very compactly in it's own little carrier. We were all very impressed with it, and she said she likes to have a few in her purse so that when she's at a department store or non-grocery store, they're tiny and easy to carry along. I think they'd make a great stocking stuffer for that EnviroMom in your life...</p>
<p>The hottest discussion topic was about Heather's <a href="../../../2007/12/major-tmi-alert/">TMI post about feminine hygiene products</a>. One of our members uses the Diva Cup and Moon Pads, and very kindly shared experiences with the rest of the group (betcha wish you could have been a fly on the wall for that discussion...). She said even on a heavy flow day, the most often she would empty the cup is twice a day. She also told us about a site called <a href="http://hagrag.com/">HagRag.com</a> that sells cloth menstrual pads. A lot of us were more than intrigued by the Diva Cup, so here's yet another great stocking stuffer idea. Or perhaps that's just too personal?</p>
<p>Betty said she just completed a survey about her satisfaction with the Oregonian, and her main concern was the plastic bags that the papers are delivered in. She suggested they work on a monthly collection of the bags for either reuse or recycling. So we are all going to <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/contactus/">share that feedback to the Oregonian</a> as well. </p>
<p>Darla, one of our new members, was wondering how we set up our recycling centers at home. She had a great idea about using bags that snap into place. I'll provide links to <a href="../../../2007/05/take_2_a_recycl/">mine</a> and <a href="../../../2007/04/a_recycling_cen/">Heather's</a> for those who are still working on setting up a recycling center that works in your home. Got a great setup? Send us a picture of yours!</p>
<p>Christy reminded us that styrofoam take-out containers have been banned in Portland restaurants, so if you see any being used, be sure to speak up and rat them out. We also shared how frustrated we are that PPS uses syrofoam trays in the hot lunch setup. Let's hope that is going to be phased out soon, and please <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/depts/nutrition/suggest.php">share your opinion with PPS Nutrition Services if you have concerns about styrofoam trays</a> as well. Last on styrofoam, there still are no Portland Metro area recyclers accepting styrofoam. Metro recommends reuse or landfilling it for now.</p>
<p>Betty suggested we mention that lids on bottles such as milk containers, water or soda containers, etc. are not to be recycled curbside. Lots of people think they belong together, but for recycling purposes, they typically are made of different plastic resins of different densities, and should not be included with the necked jars in our curbside bins. </p>
<p>OK, GreenGroupers, what else did we discuss? I'm sure I missed something. Looking forward to seeing everyone again in January!!</p>
<p>If you're wanting to be in a GreenGroup, our eastside group meets at the Urban Grind in NE. We also have a GreenGroup in Vancouver, WA, and we are forming one in the Milwaukie area. Interested? Send us an <a href="mailto:enviromompdx@gmail.com">email</a>. </p>

				<p>Stephanie just sent us a note. Perhaps you too are from the Milwaukie area, and are interested in joining a GreenGroup:</p><blockquote><p>Hello, I just discovered your site and immediately fell in love.&nbsp; I am in Milwaukie and would love to join or start a local green group.&nbsp; Are there any others in the area who are interested? </p></blockquote><p>In case you don't know, <a href="../../../greengroups/index/">GreenGroups</a> are small, informal meetings of moms or dads (ideally 6-10 people) who are all trying to raise their kids as greenly as possible. Most of our GreenGroups meet about once a month.

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A huge thank you goes out to Hope for agreeing to organize our Eastside GreenGroup. We've had tons of moms interested, but a hard time fixing a meeting time and place to get this off the ground. Our first meeting was on Friday, and Heather and I really appreciated all those who came out to the Urban Grind on such a soggy day to share and discuss green parenting ideas. Thanks also to Hope, who summarized our discussion, which I'll include here: </p><blockquote><p>I just wanted to take a minute to thank all of you for participating in the first Eastside GreenGroup meeting!&nbsp; It was a pleasure to meet all of you and share concerns and information.&nbsp; And for those of you who came late or left early, here is a little summary of some of the things we discussed:</p>
<p>Traditional Christmas tree alternatives -- <a href="http://www.livingchristmastrees.org/">Living Christmas Trees</a> provides potted Christmas trees for rent which are then sold at discount to other organizations (schools, churches, etc.) for planting.&nbsp; Another suggestion was citrus trees.</p>
<p>Becoming a &quot;killjoy&quot; -- In our attempts at becoming &quot;greener,&quot; worrying that loved-ones will label us as &quot;killjoys.&quot;&nbsp; You know, the kid who grows up and complains that he was never allowed to have birthday parties or holiday celebrations with presents.</p>
<p>Birthday parties -- Ever amazed at the excess involved in some birthday parties?&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://www.birthdayswithoutpressure.org/">Birthdays without Pressures</a>.&nbsp; Or there were a lot of alternative ideas thrown around - craft, cookie decorating, book swap, toy swap birthday parties.</p>
<p>Christmas wrapping paper alternatives -- Use or make cloth Christmas bags for presents.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.scrapaction.org/">SCRAP</a> is a great resource for fabric.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Plastics Roundup -- Check out the <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/plastic-recycling.php">Master Recycler program for all those plastics you can't put out at the curb</a>.</p>
<p>Great playgrounds -- <a href="http://www.traveloregon.com/Explore-Oregon/Willamette-Valley/Attractions/Family-Fun/RiverPlay-Discovery-Village-Playground.aspx">River Play Discovery Playground</a> in Eugene, OR and a great one in&nbsp; <a href="http://hal.loswego.k12.or.us/Newsletter/HallinanHawkNov.pdf">Lake Oswego</a>.</p>
<p>And for those of you who missed it, Rebecca shared with us that they converted their oil furnace to a furnace that runs on 99% vegetable oil.&nbsp; Pretty amazing.</p>
<p>We're hoping to meet about once a month (does the second Friday of the month sound good?).&nbsp; I'd like to get some feedback as to whether Urban Grind worked well and if not, other meeting place suggestions.</p>
<p>And a big thank you to Heather and Renee of Enviromom for organizing this meeting.&nbsp; And a big thank you to Rebecca of <a href="http://mommymilk.meetup.com/387/">Portland Green Parenting</a> for inviting her group as well.&nbsp; We had a great turnout and I am very excited about future meetings.</p></blockquote><p>Please let us know if you have any feedback on this or for future meetings of the EastSide GreenGroup. It was exciting to have 12 eastside moms with kids come out for this meeting!!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>At long last, we managed to get our <a href="../../../greengroups/index/">GreenGroup</a> together again, meeting earlier this month in SW Portland. We are pleased to welcome a new member, Christy, who had lots of great info to contribute. Christy is also a <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler</a>, and works in the field of sustainable packaging.</p>
<p>I'll try to summarize some of what we talked about, using the skimpy amounts of notes I took and my fairly faulty memory stores...</p>
<p>Erin showed some really cool little <a href="http://www.reusablebags.com/store/organic-regular-cotton-mesh-produce-bags-p-689.html">cloth produce bags</a> she got from ReuseableBags.com (hopefully I'm linking to what she actually has, and if not it'll give you the idea). She says that when she shops at New Seasons they deduct the weight of the bags (.03 and .05 ounces, depending on the size) from the weight of her bulk or produce purchases. </p>
<p>We went into the blue-sky fantasy world for a while: &quot;wouldn't it be cool if you could buy everything in bulk and not have to take home and recycle or dispose of packaging?&quot; </p>
<p>We talked about chickens, and Jen updated us about the great Portland chicken rescue people (sorry, can't remember the name of the org) who came to her aid when one of her chickens got in a tussle with the neighbor's dog. We then talked about the concept of a chicken tractor (like a moveable chicken coop) and the fact that you can have up to 3 goats or up to 3 chickens in Portland. Not like I'm going to do something about it real soon, but I am warming to the idea of my own chickens. Maybe someday...</p>
<p>Betty was making an effort to use the non automatic doors whenever possible at major retailers, just to save a little bit of energy. Which got us to joking about tail-gating a person through an automatic door, and thus we coined the term &quot;door drafting.&quot;</p>
<p>All other notes I took are meaningless at this point. Chime in if I forgot anything else worth sharing, or if you can fill in some of my blanks.</p>
<p>Our next meeting will be Friday, December 7. While the new <a href="../../../2007/11/eastside-greeng/">eastside GreenGroup kicks off this Friday, November 16</a>.</p>

				<p>The Eastside <a href="../../../enviromom/greengroup-happenings/">GreenGroup</a> will have its first meeting Friday, November 16 at 10am at <a href="http://www.urbangrindcoffee.com/">Urban Grind</a> in NE Portland! Woo hoo! We're so happy to get this group off the ground! I'll be there for this first meeting to get it kicked off. You are welcome to bring children, since Urban Grind is kid-friendly. Hope, an active voice in the EnviroMom community, has offered to help coordinate future meetings (unless someone else is dying to do it!) and she'll be there, too. If you can't make this one but would like to attend future meetings, drop us a line at enviromompdx [at] gmail [dot] com and let us know what days and times work for you. We'll try to accomodate as many people as we can. Looking forward to meeting new EnviroMoms!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>C'mon, you know you want to sit around with other like-minded moms, maybe in a comfy coffeehouse, and share ideas and questions about raising kids in an eco-friendly fashion. You know you want to. So, let's do it! I've got a couple of moms who are ready to form an eastside <a href="../../../greengroups/index/">GreenGroup</a>, but we need a few more (oh, and dads are welcome, too). I'll coordinate the first meeting, and then you can take it from there. Meetings can be as frequent as the group prefers. Renee and I were just talking about how so many of our green revelations came from the moms in our SW GreenGroup meetings. The meetings are casual, informal -- really, just an exchange of ideas and inspiration. When we started, every member was at a different 'level' of green-ness; some old pros, some newbies. But everyone has benefited. So if you're interested in joining the eastside GreenGroup, drop us a line at enviromompdx [at] gmail [dot] com and let us know what days and times work for you.</p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I have not sat and made a list of my own goals that I wish to achieve...but I am going to work on that!&nbsp; </span><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Tara</span><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">, however, has made a goal of having 10 car-less days in October!&nbsp; I think that is amazing and I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes for her!&nbsp; Maybe she will have some tips for the rest of us!&nbsp; </span></p>
