Our culture has become obsessed with Nutritionism, which focuses on the nutrients of food rather than the whole food itself. Packaged foods boast claims of 'loaded with vitamins! omega-3! whole grains!' when in reality these foods break down in our bodies as glucose, and we end up eating more and more because we never feel satisfied. We're busy worrying that we're not getting enough fiber or we're eating too many carbs, when we should be thinking about the food itself, how we eat it, where we eat it and from where it comes.</p>
<p>Pollan delves into the history of processed foods, and it is both fascinating and frustrating. Big money is being made at the expense of the population's health, and the poor suffer the most because the food is so cheap and so unhealthy. Most of the food Americans eat is fast -- either from a restaurant or a box popped into the microwave. We have no 'food culture' in the US that celebrates food (think about the French, Italians, Japanese) where every meal is eaten slowly with other people and savored. He offers suggestions for how we can change our own approach to mealtimes, shopping and cooking.</p>
<p>The book is not long, and Pollan has such an engaging writing style that even a reluctant reader could really get into it. I'm still processing it and trying to figure out how to apply it to my own family. My husband is reading it next, and I'm anxious to discuss it with him. Lucky for Portland, <a href="http://www.edibleportland.com/2008/01/feb_12_event_mi.html">Michael Pollan will be in town next week</a> (thank you, Powell's) to discuss his book: Tuesday, February 12 at 7pm at the Bagdad Theater (SE 37th & Hawthorne). Tickets are $21.95, which includes a copy of the book, and are available through <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/">Ticketmaster</a>, the Bagdad or Crystal Ballroom box offices. See you there?!</p>
<p>(And here's a nice, long excerpt from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=7c85a1c254546157&amp;ex=1327640400">NY Times</a>.)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last year, Heather and I decided to subscribe to the <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a> Community Supported Agriculture program without a lot of forethought. At the time when we signed up last spring, we were fairly new on our green journey, excitedly trying new things. Joining a CSA seemed like the right thing to do. We'd split a full box and pick it up weekly at the Hillsdale Farmers' Market. What we found was that being in the CSA had its <a href="../../2007/11/first-time-csa-/">highs and lows</a>. So there was <em>much discussion</em> this year on whether we would do it again. Gathering Together Farm lets last year's subscribers enroll before opening it to the general public. Although we went down the wire on our decision, ultimately we decided to go for it. There's no question that the CSA produce we ate last summer was the tastiest, healthiest we had ever had. There was a lovely feeling of community in meeting each weekend at our local farmer's market, running into old friends, meeting new ones. But there was also the frustration of having onions, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and squash coming out of our ears at times. We felt like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wp3m1vg06Q">Lucy and Ethel trying to keep up with the chocolates in that famous assembly line episode</a>. </p>
<p>But I do think we learned some important lessons. The most valuable: prep and freeze in small batches for the winter. Michelle told us that she'd take her box home every Sunday (our designated pickup day) and chop, prep and freeze everything she didn't think her family would eat that week. What a revelation. I had got myself all hyped to do big canning jobs, but when it came down to it, really didn't have the time or energy to do that. When I tried Michelle's approach and chopped and froze small portions of produce, it worked. I can't tell you how happy I've been to pop a chopped pepper out of the freezer and throw it into a curry I'm making for dinner. </p>
<p>The other thing we learned is that we have to be ready. We had grand visions of preserving fresh berries by dehydration. But come berry season -- which really sneaks up on you -- we didn't have a dehydrator. We hadn't researched one. Which one was the best? Gosh, did we really want to add another appliance to our appliance-filled kitchens? Would we really use it? How would we store our dehydrated produce once we'd dried it? A case of analysis paralysis. Flash back to the scene of Lucy and Ethel. My family was buying and eating fresh berries as fast as our local farmers could grow them. Then it was melons. And the squash and tomatoes and pepper piles were piling up. So, it just never happened. </p>
<p>This year will be different. I'm researching that dehydrator now. So I'm excited about our next CSA season. And happy to know that we've inspired lots of friends to take that plunge, and join a CSA of their own. Are you new to joys of CSA? What are some of the valuable lessons you've learned, that you'd like to share?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We're all for locally farmed foods getting into Oregon schools. How about you? Here's the deal on what's being considered by the Oregon legislature on January 23:</p><blockquote><p>Locally grown foods will become more prevalent in school cafeterias by the end of this year under a new farm-to-school and school garden concept now under consideration in the Oregon Legislature. Introduced by the Oregon Farm-to-School and School Garden Network, a broad coalition of agricultural, economic, public health and environmental organizations, the legislative concept (LC 79) will be considered at a hearing before the House Education Committee on January 23, 2008. </p>
<p>LC 79 would create a pilot farm-to-school and school garden program in the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) Child Nutrition Program (CNP). The CNP administers the state’s school meals program and is the sole state agency with the technical expertise and relationships necessary to assist schools, interpret current regulations, and facilitate the purchase of food products that meet state and federal guidelines.</p>
<p>During the regular 2007 legislative session, the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) was authorized to work with Oregon’s agricultural community to capitalize on the purchasing power of K-12 schools around the state. To maximize ODA efforts, it is critical to create and fund a corollary position and program in ODE to work effectively with ODA’s farm-to-school program. The proposed 2008 legislation will fill a critical inter-agency coordination gap so that both state agencies can work effectively with schools around the state to develop farm-to-school programs.</p></blockquote>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2008/01/shopping-around/">Shopping around: organics on a budget</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Betty from our <a href="../../greengroups/index/">GreenGroup</a> is like many of us. She wants to buy organic as much as possible, but the prices can sometimes make it cost prohibitive. Here's her experience:</p><blockquote><p>H/R:&nbsp; In 2008, I want to purchase more organic foods, so I found the following article -- <a href="http://sagemommy.com/organiconabudget.html">Organics on a Budget</a> -- written by a green mom interesting.&nbsp; It made me think about why I have never made it a regular practice to purchase organic foods more consistently in the first place.&nbsp; The first things that usually come to mind are higher prices and having a more difficult time finding organics in the places that I normally shop.&nbsp; I have no idea whether these statements are factually true or not, but because I believed them to true, I hadn't made any effort to disprove them. </p>
<p>When I lived in San Francisco, I thought organic foods were priced much more expensively in comparison to their non-organic counterparts.&nbsp; On my way home from work, I often passed by a small organic store.&nbsp; I never thought to go into it though because of the price issue.&nbsp; Then, over the years, I one day found myself in the store because I was desperately needing an item (probably milk), and decided that it was much easier for me to walk here and get a carton and save lots of time in the process.&nbsp; Even though I might have to pay more for it, I was willing to make the trade-off.&nbsp; Well, much to my pleasant surprise, I remember the milk costing a little bit less than the supermarket that was a 10 minute walk away!&nbsp; So, after this positive experience, I found myself walking to this store more often to get my milk on the way home from work.&nbsp; Then, one thing led to another, and I started buying fruits and vegies there.&nbsp; Over a period of time, as the store began to have more regular shoppers, it seemed to me that the prices slowly started to come down so that they were more comparable to the prices set at chain stores for the same items.</p>
<p>Have you noticed a price decrease in organic products in the time that you have been shopping for organic products?</p></blockquote><p>It would seem that if more people are buying organics, then the prices might come down as organics becomes more the norm. On the flipside, I think I've read that because demand for organics is growing so quickly, the prices may go up to meet demand. I do think there's a lot of value in shopping around. Market of Choice seems to regularly have much lower prices on organic milk than Fred Meyer does (two of my regular shopping haunts). </p>
<p>Do you shop around? What have your experiences with organic food prices been? </p>

I vaguely remember those early days, fresh from the hospital, with a tiny bundle that seemed to keep me up all hours of the day. Who had the energy to cook? Check out some of these options that cater to babes and parents-of-babes:</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>If you're trying to serve up local fare this season then make a trip to the downtown <a href="http://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/">Portland Farmers Market</a> this Saturday, December 22 from 9:30am to 2pm. The market is located on the SW Park blocks at Portland State University. Here's the lowdown (love the Veggie Valet idea!):</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Find holiday treats, hostess gifts or last minute presents for everyone on your list, including artisan baked goods and cheeses, fruit preserves and syrups, fine chocolates, dried fruits and nuts, plus honey and beeswax candles. Think about the cold months ahead and stockpile meats and winter veggies for hearty soups and stews. <br/><br/>Bring the kids for a craft demonstration, where they’ll learn how embellish candles with leaves, bark, herbs, and other creative decorations. Sip a cup of complimentary hot cocoa and enjoy music provided by local band Portland Revels on the main stage. <br/><br/>Services for Shoppers: Assemble a Gift Box or “Park” your Parcels. Stop by the Gift Station and pick up a checklist of gift ideas to get you started. Or, peruse the stalls for inspiration. Then, return to the Gift Station to select a ribbon and trimmings, and watch as volunteers transform your collection into an attractive gift box ready to be delivered in person, or secured to send through the mail. <br/><br/>For shoppers out gathering winter provisions, the Veggie Valet, located next to the Market’s Information Booth, will store heavy purchases while you peruse the market. The service, which works like a coat check, allows shoppers to drop of their wares, take a card and pick up bags on the way out. Both services are free of charge, with short-term parking available for loading.</p></blockquote>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I've been drooling over <a href="http://www.culinate.com/home">Culinate</a>, a blog out of Portland that takes a deep look at food -- where it comes from, how to prepare it, and how to live well by eating well (thanks for the heads up, Julie G.). Many of the writers live in Portland, so these articles tend to reference local food, farms and farmers markets. I love the section <a href="http://www.culinate.com/cook/produce_diaries">Produce Diaries</a> where people write about what's in their weekly CSA bin and suggest recipes for preparation (wish I'd seen this four months ago). And just in the nick of time: <a href="http://www.culinate.com/read/culinate8/Leftover+bread">10 ways to use stale bread</a> (as I have two hard-as-rocks Grand Central loaves waiting in the wings).</p>
<p>After a summer of CSA eating, I've pretty much given up my focus on local food this winter. My children are so picky about vegetables and other foods that I feel they would shrivel up into old, forgotten mushrooms by springtime if I tried to feed them beets, rutabagas and kale. And the satsumas out of California are about the only thing keeping me from going back to bed on a dark, rainy day...so sweet, like a little burst of sunshine. Can't give 'em up. I'm still shopping the Hillsdale Farmers Market and picking up mushrooms, cheese, bread and Kookoolan chickens (but no eggs, wah). But I just can't devote the time and energy to creatively cooking the foods in season NOW to trick my kids into eating them. (This is when I really wish I had frozen lots of green beans from the summer and canned those juicy tomatoes.) I'm glad Culinate is here to inject a little inspiration and positive local food reinforcement.</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://givegreenfest.com/">Give Green! Holiday Food & Gift Festival</a> is this weekend, November 17 & 18 at the Doubletree Hotel Lloyd Center. The festival will feature local, sustainable, handmade and organic gifts just in time for the holidays. Sounds like fun.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Are you giving green this year? Care to share some gift ideas? I was thinking that <a href="http://www.reusablebags.com/store/reusable-bottles-sigg-bottles-c-19_33.html">Sigg</a> or <a href="http://www.reusablebags.com/store/stainless-steel-klean-kanteen-c-19_25_35.html?osCsid=93e0a934edda8203aefd3aa4e006d84c">Klean Kanteen</a> water bottles would make perfect gifts -- very cool, healthy and priced just high enough that some people wouldn't buy one for themselves. Over the summer I bought some mango pepper jelly at the <a href="http://www.hillsdalefarmersmarket.com/">Hillsdale Farmers Market</a> from the Crabapple & Company stand, which was OUTSTANDING. They also have pear pepper jelly. Just unusual enough (and local!) for a good gift. (And they'll be at the market through Christmas.) A cute <a href="http://littlegreenstar.com/">organic kid's cotton t-shirt</a> presented in a <a href="http://luckycrow.com/">fabric gift bag</a> would be awfully sweet.

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Several years ago I started buying Oroweat 100% Whole Wheat bread. I love it. It's big and soft and has a hint of sweetness to it. It's the only sandwich bread I fed my kids, and I've always given myself a little pat on the back for getting them to love whole wheat bread. Then one day I read the ingredients. Can you guess what the third ingredient is? High fructose corn syrup! Are you kidding me? Why, oh why? Apparently that's why it tastes so good.</p>
<p>So we've been on the hunt for alternatives. Tried the New Seasons whole wheat sandwich bread -- son and I loved it, daughter hated it. Tried <a href="http://www.daveskillerbread.com/">Dave's Killer Bread</a> -- husband and I love it, kids hate it (but it's pretty expensive, so that's fine with me). Then one day I noticed a loaf of <a href="http://www.usbakery.com/index.php?page=big-horn-valley-all-natural-100-whole-wheat">Franz Big Horn Valley 100% Whole Wheat Bread</a>. And they proudly proclaim on the wrapper: No High Fructose Corn Syrup! And all the ingredients are natural. Bonus: it's made here in Portland. The kids like it, I like it (though it's not as soft as the Oroweat) and so our search is over. What are you slathering PB & J on these days?</p>

				<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/31/dscn0509_2.jpg"><img title="Dscn0509_2" height="187" alt="Dscn0509_2" src="../../images/2007/10/31/dscn0509_2.jpg" width="250" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> Renee and I and our friend, April, came together Sunday afternoon for a good old-fashioned apple butter-making party. There is nothing, I mean nothing, like spreading homemade apple butter on a slice of warm toast in the morning or swirling it into a steaming bowl of oatmeal. Mmm. With the holidays approaching (egad) it never hurts to have a few jars of homemade preserves on hand for gifts of gratitude. So, armed with peelers, jars, canning equipment and 30 pounds of Mt. Hood Fuji apples, we got to work. </p>
<p>I had never canned before, but Renee and April had, so it was a great learning experience for me. I don't think I would have had the guts to do it on my own (I have a vague memory of a jar of freshly canned tomato sauce exploding in the kitchen of my childhood). The classic recipe came from the red gingham-covered Better Homes & Gardens cookbook that called for basic ingredients: sugar, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, apple cider and apples. We sat around my old red dinette table, peeling, coring, slicing, drinking wine, noshing and gabbing (nothin' like it). </p>
<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/31/dscn0508_2.jpg"><img title="Dscn0508_2" height="187" alt="Dscn0508_2" src="../../images/2007/10/31/dscn0508_2.jpg" width="250" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px"/></a> Seven hours later...we had 48 half-pint jars of creamy apple goodness. Yep, it took awhile (good thing we like one another). Most of the time we just sat around waiting for either the apples to boil down and soften or the mixture to simmer and thicken. The actual canning part went pretty quickly. In assembly line fashion, one of us filled the jars, one wipe them clean and pulled freshly-sterilized jars from the dish washer, and one put on the lids. Five minutes in the hot-water bath, et voila, homemade apple butter. </p>
<p>I think altogether we spent $40 on ingredients and extra jars, which comes out to about 83 cents a jar. Money savings aside, it was a wonderful way to preserve some of the bounty of Oregon, stock our cabinets and gift bags with a tasty spread, and enjoy the company of good friends.</p>

It's like someone turned on a switch, and it's all he wants. Sometimes just plain apples sliced up, sometimes slathered in peanut butter. I could not be happier. We're smack into apple season right now, and I just bought loads of Hood River Fuji apples to make apple butter. (Oregon's apple season ends in early November.) Now I'm thinking about buying loads more to store for the winter. Until a few months ago I didn't pay that much attention to food origins, so I can't remember whether the grocery stores carry Oregon apples through the winter. It seems like they might carry Washington apples. </p>
<p>I bought my Hood River apples out at The Pumpkin Patch on Sauvie Island for 59 cents a pound, which seems like a fantastic price (though they weren't organic). There were some organic varieties at the farmers market for $1.50/pound last week. I've been doing some research on apple storage and have come up with a couple of different storage suggestions:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><a href="http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles/fallick41.html">Backwoods Home Magazine</a> suggests wrapping each individual apple in newspaper and storing them in a cardboard box in a cool spot, like an unheated garage or enclosed porch. The apples need to be in perfect condition -- no bruises or holes -- and should keep for 3-4 months. A number of other sites suggested this storage technique.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2897_store-apples.html">eHow</a> says to store perfect apples in a plastic bag in the crisper compartment of the refrigerator, but they will only keep for 6 weeks.</p></blockquote><p>Have you ever successfully stored apples for 3-4 months? Any tips and techniques to share? Gotta keep my boy in apples, and I'd love it if they were local! </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We try not to eat out often. Part of my concern is the cost. Part of my concern is the question of where the food comes from, and how nutritious it really is. Part of it is that my kids seem to then want to eat out all the time. But mostly it's the waste that is generated in the restaurant business. </p>
<p>Having taken the <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler</a> course, I have a better understanding of how challenging it is for a Portland Metro restaurant to implement composting and recycling plans: Unlike with residential waste/recycling haulers who use the hauler that is assigned to their geographical area, businesses bid for haulers from all over the area, and typically hire one that gives them the best price. So myriad haulers criss-cross all over town, serving only the businesses they have contracted with, and sometimes a hauler's offerings for recycling/composting are slim to none. </p>
<p>So it's beyond exciting to hear about <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/news-21/1192580268282530.xml&amp;storylist=orlocal">Burgerville's plan to expand a composting and recycling pilot to all 39 of their restaurants</a>.&nbsp; Burgerville is an established leader in local food purchasing, recycling cooking oil for biodiesel production, and a big customer of renewable power. This move really takes them one step further down the road to sustainability and makes them even more of a role model. They <a href="../../2007/04/ode_to_burgervi/">won my heart with their killer turkey burger</a>, and they keep me coming back with each additional green-thinking business decision they implement. It's inspiring to see that restaurants can find a way to be green despite the challenges they face.</p>

This description of <a href="http://www.farmtoschool.org/state-programs.php?action=detail&amp;id=47&amp;pid=121">Portland Public School's program</a> jumped out at me:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>The district has engaged in a visioning process to work towards making healthy, nutritious foods readily available to all students, with significant goals such as 100% of menu items prepared regionally; 50% of menu items sourced locally; hormone, antibiotic and nitrate free meats to the extent possible; dairy products that are free of recombinant bovine growth hormone; fish products from sustainable sources; and fruits and vegetables that are sustainably or organically grown.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Just by chance I checked out Vermont's programs and discovered <a href="http://www.vtfeed.org/index.html">VT FEED</a> (Vermont Food Education Every Day). They use a <a href="http://www.farmtoschool.org/state-programs.php?action=detail&amp;id=24&amp;pid=57">three pronged approach to local food education</a>: </p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p class="normal">1. The Classroom, with standard-based food, farm, and nutrition-based curriculum that involves in-depth graduate level teacher training, including summer workshops and in-class mentoring;</p>
<p class="normal">2. The Cafeteria, through the integration of local food and nutrition education through food service institutes, in-cafeteria mentoring, and peer support;</p>
<p class="normal">3. The Community, through reconnecting people to their food sources- the farms and farmers.</p></blockquote><p class="normal" dir="ltr">All very exciting stuff. </p>

The one from the store was a brown, cage-free, hormone-free, vegetarian-feed fed chicken egg, from whereabouts unknown, that probably cost about $3/dozen. The one from Kookoolan Farms, 35 minutes away in Yamhill, Oregon, was brown, laid by a pasture-raised chicken, and was probably plucked from the nest within 48 hours before I bought it. A dozen eggs from Kookoolan Farms cost $5. For added perspective, I drove by a Walgreens today that advertised eggs for 79 cents.</p>
<p>That's a pretty wide range! Why would someone spend $5 when they could spend less than $1 on eggs? Well, for one thing, I know where this egg came from, and I know how the chicken was raised. I know the farmers, Chrissie and Koorosh Zaerpoor, that raised the chicken, and thanks to last week's article in the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/foodday/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/1191614109210660.xml&amp;coll=7">Oregonian's FoodDay</a>, I know what they went through to bring those eggs and chickens to my table. This is without a doubt the closest relationship I've ever had with protein. $5 seems like a bargain.</p>
<p>Many would argue that most people can't afford $5 for a dozen eggs. And frankly, it's pretty hard to find fresh eggs anyways, so there's simply not enough to go around (I have to get to the market within 30 minutes of opening to get those Kookoolan eggs before they sell out). But, what if that is just what eggs cost? Would people really stop buying them? (I really don't know -- just thinking out loud here.) I have to believe that lifestyle adjustments would be made, since eggs are a staple.  </p>
<p>I hope I don't sound preachy, because I have no room to preach. But when you put food side by side and put a name and place to its origins, it's really hard to get excited about the overabundance of cheap food in the stores. I've also found that I can spend $5 on a dozen eggs by cutting out things like Goldfish crackers, dry cereal and other convenience foods. Buying from the farmer tends to give you a better appreciation of nutritional value and the true cost of food. I hope we see more chicken farmers like the Zaerpoors cropping up (so to speak). </p>
<p>By the way, the egg on the right is from Kookoolan -- bright orange, thick, meaty and delicious. </p>

Now I understand why you aren't supposed to plant tomatoes in July. Because by the time they are ready for pickin', it's freakin' 60 degrees out and they look so bedraggled and hopeless. Those little green balls, hanging on for dear life, wishing I'd knit them a sweater. I wonder why we keep getting luscious ripe ones in our weekly CSA bin? So many that we accumulated quite a bowl full. And those sweet bell peppers keep on coming, too. Renee and I ran into a mutual acquaintance as we were divvying up our produce at the farmers market, and she advised us to dice and freeze our tomatoes for soups and sauces. Really. Just wash, dice, put in freezer bag. So that's what I spent the afternoon doing: freezing tomatoes and bell peppers.</p>

But in the winter time they all come from waaay down south. Now we've got enough local peppers for several winter meals. It's weird how just taking the little bit of effort to <a href="../../2007/10/preserving-peac/">freeze those peaches</a> has suddenly made me want to preserve everything I can during these waning harvest days. Wish I'd thought to put some green beans on ice.</p>

Katherine writes about her family's (including two young children) quest to eat as locally as possible on her blog <a href="http://www.dirttodish.blogspot.com/">Dirt to Dish</a>. Her posts are full of details about what she's buying, how much she's spending (trying to stick to the USDA family budget!) and her struggles to source certain local foods. I'm so inspired by her dedication and awed by the time it must take her to research and plan menus, while both working and raising two children. I love her writing style and down-to-earth honesty. I'd like to hear more about her menus and recipes (hint, hint) and what types of things she's getting her kids to eat. </p>
<p>While I haven't limited my shopping to only local foods, I do *try* to buy as local as possible (fruit is tricky -- but have you tried those local peaches lately -- oh yum). As we head into colder months, and the availability of fresh local produce dwindles, I can see challenges ahead. My CSA subscription ends at the end of October, and I'm already in mourning. I'm not sure how well kale and root veggies will go over with my crew. But now that I've become aware of the <a href="../../2007/03/a_funny_thing_h/">'true cost of food'</a> I'm not sure I can bring myself to buy red bell peppers from the grocery store in February. I'll be eagerly following Katherine's adventures this winter!</p>

As always it's chock full of interesting (and tasty) articles that celebrate our paradise of local food. One of the articles talks about a growing 'Found Food' movement in Portland, which is supported by a Web site called <a href="http://urbanedibles.org/">Urban Edibles</a>. The Web site is basically a database of locations around the city where food is growing -- food that anyone can pick for themselves (as long as you ask -- see the Ethics category). There are so many fruit trees and other edibles growing in the city limits that are not being harvested and are rotting. The database enables urbanites in search of home-grown, and often organic, foods to share the bounty at no cost.</p>
<p>Examples are: a fig tree growing in the parking lot of a business; a mass of blackberry bushes along a road; rosemary growing in a parking strip. The locations seem to be a mix of publicly-accessed spots and private residences whose owners can't keep up with the harvest. Sadly, there are only a handful of locations in SW Portland; the vast majority are on the east side. But what a fantastic resource! You get a hankering for a fresh pear? Look it up, and go pick one! Has anyone tried this yet?</p>

While I've never managed to read Proust's epic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time"><em>Remembrance of Things Past</em></a>, I've managed to hear about the memories evoked from eating the madeleine cakes more times than I can count. Now I've just had a similar experience. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Heather and I met at the farmer's market to pick up and split our <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a> CSA box as we've done pretty much every weekend for the past three months. I'd accidentally left my wallet at home, so was unable to buy extra melons, bread and tomatoes as I'd hoped. Heather had no cash to lend, but did graciously let me take the watermelon that was part of our box. </p>
<p>Having promised my cantaloupe-loving 3-year-old some melon, we cut open the watermelon for dinner. It was glorious. Surprisingly, it was not pink, but yellow. And unlike most watermelons you buy from stores, it had delectable flavor, extreme juiciness, a sweet perfume and loads of black seeds. Eating that watermelon brought me back a good 30 years or so (how did I get this old?). We were talking about how when we were little, watermelon only came once a year. And we'd sit out in the yard, getting all drippy and sticky, and we'd spit the seeds (our parents allowing us to do this, even encouraging us sometimes!). Or we'd tease the little ones saying if they ate the seeds that watermelons would grow in their tummies. It's hard to believe I'd forgotten all that stuff. And harder still to
believe that all this time has passed since I'd eaten a watermelon
tasty enough to evoke it. My kids also marveled at how it was yellow, and that so often the varieties that get sold in stores are selected because they travel well, have been bred to be seedless, or fit a picture of what something is supposed to look like. But taste like crap. Or worse yet, like nothing. That describes most of the melons I've eaten over the past several years (not counting the locally and organically grown ones we've had this year). </p>
<p>One luscious watermelon. Eating all this locally grown produce has helped me realize what summer is all about.</p>

I really love what they are doing and hope to see more small poultry and livestock farms follow suit. (And their chickens are <a href="../../2007/07/pasture-fed-chi/">delicious</a>!) I've been receiving the newsletter from the farm and thought I'd pass on their latest. (If you want to receive the newsletter, email them at kookoolan [at] gmail [dot] com.) It's an interesting look into the challenges of poultry farming:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>The moral problems of farming. One of the facts of life of free-range poultry farming is predators. Fully one-third of our tiny five-acre farm is a riparian wilderness that we have never penetrated. A small creek runs through our property, and “the other side of the creek” is a 1.5-acre woodlot overrun by brambles, and located right in the Yamhill River Valley migratory bird path. We frequently hear coyotes at night, and we have seen turkey vultures, falcons and assorted raptors, raccoons, possums, and large feral cats, each of whom has had a free meal or two at our expense. We have respect for wildlife, and onesy-twosy kinds of losses, whether of meat chickens or egg-laying chickens, we can put up with. Really neither of us much has the stomach for trapping and shooting. Once we get to three or four losses with a similar pattern, then we have to declare war. This week again we have found a couple of egg-laying bird remains, which makes us vigilant but not quite on the warpath. </p>

				<p>Best. Chicken. Ever.</p>
<p>Wondering what real chicken tastes like? Try <a href="../../2007/07/found-it-a-sour/">pasture-fed</a>. Yes, it is more expensive ($17 for 3.75 pounds). But I'm a recent convert to the whole &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; way of thinking. I roasted it for dinner last night (stuffed with garlic and an orange - yum) and have enough left over for a 2nd dinner. Then, for the FIRST TIME EVER, I made my own chicken stock (because I wanted to get every bit of my $17 out of that hen). I tossed the carcass in a soup pot, covered it with water, threw in some farm-fresh carrots and onions, some dried herbs, salt, pepper and simmered it for about four hours. After removing everything I could with a slotted spoon, I ended up with eight cups of tasty stock, which I stored in freezer bags. <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=300,height=200,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/16/camilla_2.jpg"><img title="Camilla_2" height="83" alt="Camilla_2" src="../../images/2007/07/16/camilla_2.jpg" width="125" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px"/></a> </p>

People were lined up, asking all kinds of questions and buying chickens that had just been slaughtered yesterday. I <a href="../../2007/05/a_source_for_pa/">posted</a> awhile back about my search for pasture-fed chicken, and I can't wait to cook up my 3.75 pounder for dinner tonight! They are only selling at the Hillsdale and McMinnville markets, but anyone can call them up or come out to the farm to buy chickens. <a href="http://www.threesquare.com/">Three Square Grill</a> and <a href="http://www.nostrana.com/">Nostrana</a> also cook with their chickens. Here's the scoop:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Kookoolan Farm's transitional organic, truly free-range, pasture-fed chickens live outdoors, exercising or resting at their pleasure, foraging for bugs and grass as birds should. Certified organic feed. No hormones. No antibiotics. No medications. No cages. No artificial lighting. No confinement. No crowded transportation to slaughter. Contains no retained water from processing.</p>
<p>Our chickens are naturally raised in small flocks of 200 and respectfully hand-processed on the farm where they were raised. Our Oregon Department of Agriculture licensed processing facility is located right on our farm. Our hand-processed chickens are humanely killed, then air-chilled to obtain optimum flavor and texture.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Cost is $3.75 per pound, whole chickens, fresh or frozen. Contact them at 503-662-4742 or kookoolan [at] gmail [dot] com. At the Hillsdale market, their stand is at the very end, closest to Rieke Elementary. In addition, the farm also sells raw cow and goat's milk -- call or email for more info.</p>
<p>Yeehaw! Will this be the best chicken I've ever tasted (if I manage to cook it successfully)? I'll report back...</p>

My CSA subscription, which I love, has definitely been a challenge. I'm not a confident cook, so cooking is always a bit of a challenge. Well, I was determined to make something with all this bounty for dinner, so I hopped on to <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/">Epicurious</a> and found a recipe that used five (five!) produce items that I just happened to have: baby potatoes, carrots and beets (which I roasted), curly endive, and dill (for the dressing). I broiled a couple of chicken breasts, made a simple salad dressing, et voila. Roasted vegetable and chicken salad! I would have cooked this all on the grill, but I couldn't get it started. The best part is that I was able to feed my kids the chicken, carrots and potatoes separately, and then toss everything else together and douse it in dressing for us parents. It's the little victories that get me through the day.</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/foodday/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/living/1183143319117020.xml&amp;coll=7">Oregonian's FOODday section today</a> has an excellent article on simple ways to preserve fresh, farmers market berries, greens and vegetables. Busy, working woman Laura Ohm shares her quick and easy tips for freezing, canning and pickling the harvest without adding a whole lot of extra time and work. Once a week, while she's cooking dinner, she'll do a little preserving so that by the end of summer she has stored enough fruits and vegetables to last throughout the winter. Even frozen, the veggies taste way better than grocery store fresh veggies in the wintertime (which have traveled thousands of miles), plus she is saving a ton of money. She subscribes to two shares of a CSA! (Renee and I split one share and I still struggle to use it all!)</p>
<p>Renee shared her <a href="../../2007/06/strawberry-free/">freezer jam</a> experience recently, and this article shares tips for freezing berries (stick them right into the freezer, pint container and all) and future uses beyond jam. I am definitely going to try freezing fresh spinach and arugula, because I love tossing it with pasta in the winter. And while my kids won't touch them, my husband and I love beets, so I'm thinking I'll try some pickling. Do you have any quick and easy preserving tips to share?</p>

				<p>OK, how's that for an overly sensational, ripped from the headlines kind of title? Pretty good. If I do say so myself.</p>
<p>But back to reality. There was a little tiny article in our paper today that jumped out at me: &quot;China has closed 180 food factories after inspectors found industrial chemicals being used in products from candy to seafood, state media said today.&quot;</p>
<p>Said chemicals include:</p>
<ul><li>Formaldehyde</li>
<li>Illegal dyes</li>
<li>Industrial wax</li></ul>
<p>Being used to make:</p>
<ul><li>Candy</li>
<li>Pickles</li>
<li>Crackers</li>
<li>Seafood</li></ul>
<p>Yum!! Now let's not forget about the Chinese wheat gluten tainted with melamine that killed all those dogs and cats. And those Thomas trains coated with lead-based paint.</p>
<p>The writing is on the wall, people. Was there ever a better reason to buy local? <a href="http://greenwoman.typepad.com/biggreenpurse/2007/06/stop_buying_toy.html">Diane of The Big Green Purse suggests we stop buying toys made in China</a>. Probably not a bad idea. And, Heather's given us a <a href="../../2007/06/umpqua-bank-off/">great reason to shop locally in the Portland Metro area</a>. Your good health and life may be depending on it!!</p>

				<p>I know. I'm as surprised as you. When Renee and I opened up our weekly CSA container of produce today, my heart sank when I saw the kale. My one experience with kale left me bitter because it was so darn, well, bitter. So here I had a head of black kale. Thankfully the <a href="http://www.gatheringtogetherfarm.com/">Gathering Together Farm</a> also includes recipes with each batch of produce, so last night I cooked it up. Verdict: two green thumbs up. Little did I know, collard greens are basically the same as kale, so the delicious collard greens I've enjoyed at the <a href="http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/8461967/">Delta Cafe</a> all these years have been kale all along! Kale is thicker and veinier than most greens, so it doesn't suit everyone's taste. In the south, it's often cooked with pork fat or bits of sausage. It's pretty hearty. If you've never tried it, now is the time. Here's the recipe from the farm:</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A rallying cry of the environmental movement is to buy local goods. <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?show=hardcover:sale:9780805076264:17.50">Bill McKibben's book <em>Deep Economy</em></a> talks about the greater impact currency has if it is exchanged within a local market. There's even a Portland-based group called <a href="http://www.thinklocalportland.org/">ThinkLocalPortland</a>. I have an aunt who takes local to the extreme: she will only eat an animal if she knows it by first name (i.e., she knows who raised it, how and when, etc.). So while I don't think I'll get that extreme any time soon, I am making an effort to buy local goods. And all of this leads into a discussion we had at our last <a href="../../greengroups/index/">GreenGroup</a> meeting about how far away something can be to still be considered local. One suggested within a 90-mile radius. I'm wondering what others think: how do you define local? Is it different for food and other goods (such as shampoo, paper products and soaps).</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Wouldn't it be great if our kids were served more locally-grown foods in the school cafeteria? Well, there are a few things you can do to show your support for the Food and Farm bill. Check out this ACTION ALERT we received from the <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/farmtoschool/">EcoTrust Food & Farms</a> program:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>We need your help today to get Oregon's Farm to School bills passed. </strong>Key decisions will be made this week. Now is the time to call your legislators in Salem. </p>
<p>Oregon is one of a handful of states that doesn't contribute additional funds to support implementation of the National School Lunch and Breakfast program. Now it's catch up time. Let's improve the quality of food we're serving our kids, while simultaneously supporting Oregon farmers. While we're at it, let's fund school gardens and ensure that children across the state learn that carrots grow in the ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In April, the House Education Committee unanimously sent all three Farm to School bills on to the Joint Ways and Means Committee</strong>. <br/>Why wouldn't they? With no opposition, these are &quot;apple pie&quot; bills. But that doesn't mean it's time to break out the ice cream. These bills, great as they are, won't get passed unless we keep the pressure on to find the money to pay for them! </p>
<p><u>Please contact members of the Joint Ways and Means Committee and show your support.</u><br/>The final frontier for these bills is a funding decision that can only be made by the Joint Ways and Means Committee. The Oregon State Legislature will likely wrap up business at the end of June. Let's make sure our elected officials fund the Farm to School bills before breaking for the summer. </p>
<p>There are four key legislators who need to hear from you: </p>
<p>Senator Kurt Schrader – (D) Canby; Ways and Means Co-Chair, 503-986-1720&nbsp; <a title="blocked::mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us" target="_blank">sen.kurtschrader@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Representative Mary Nolan – (D) SW Portland; Ways and Means Co-Chair, 503-986-1436&nbsp; <a title="blocked::mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:rep.marynolan@state.or.us" target="_blank">rep.marynolan@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Senator Richard Devlin – (D) Tualatin; Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources Co-Chair, 503-986-1719 <a title="blocked::mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us" target="_blank">sen.richarddevlin@state.or.us</a> </p>
<p>Representative Brian Clem – (D) Salem; Ways and Means Subcommittee on Natural Resources Co-Chair, 503-986-1421 <a title="blocked::mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:rep.brianclem@state.or.us" target="_blank">rep.brianclem@state.or.us</a> (Sponsor of HB 3307 and HB 3185) </p>
<p>Key Messages to Legislators:<br/>(1) The bills (HB 3476, HB 3307, HB 3185) create new market opportunities for Oregon farmers and food processors, fund schools to buy Oregon agricultural products, and support school-based learning gardens. </p>
<p>(2) The bills deserve attention from the Joint Ways and Means Committee ASAP. </p>
<p>(3) The Oregon State Legislature should prioritize and pass all three bills. </p>
<p>How to Make Contact:<br/><u>Call the Legislators Listed Above.</u> Use the phone numbers above to make a personal call. Leave a message with the legislator, staff member, or on the answering service stating the key messages listed above (with bill numbers) and how you can be reached. </p>
<p><u>Send an E-mail.</u> Express your support in an e-mail. Be sure your e-mail includes your home or business address. Specify the bill numbers (see above) and reiterate the key messages above. Personalize your e-mail if possible – why are the bills important to you? </p>
<p><u>Forward this Action Alert.</u> Urge others you may know in the critical districts above to call their legislators. </p>
<p><u>Don't Stop at the Four Above.</u> Call your own legislators, too. Even if they don't sit on the Joint Ways and Means Committee, urge them to keep close track of these bills anyway. Need help with contact information? See the links above. </p>
<p><u>Get Creative</u>: Have your seven year old call, send a note from a high school student, ask the legislator you are contacting what they had for lunch! </p>
<p><u>Sign up for Additional Action Alerts</u>: <br/>Visit <a onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://whatcounts.com/t?r=915&amp;c=951523&amp;l=37310&amp;ctl=17BC67E:9E47577DB96EEB3A80B8C8289600E1827DDB2469356655AC" target="_blank">www.ecotrust.org/farmtoschool</a> for more information and to sign up for additional action alerts. </p></blockquote>

				<p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/18-9781594200823-0">The Omnivore's Dilemma</a> by Michael Pollan, and it's completely blown my mind. I'm not a vegetarian, nor do I intend to become one, but I imagine I'll be cooking less meat from now on. Up until now I've always thought buying &quot;organic, free-range chicken&quot; meant that my chicken had once been out pecking at grubs in the wide outdoors, the wind ruffling its downy feathers. Ha. Free-range simply means that chickens aren't kept in a cage, but they can be kept in a large building (free to roam). Thousands of them. Being fed organic corn, not grubs. Yes, there is a door! To the outside! But these simple-minded animals have never seen the outdoors so they are too scared to go out there. Chances are, my free-range chicken lived its entire seven-week life in a stinky, dark building. How is that natural? (Stepping off of soap-box now...)</p>
<p>I know that <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/dynamicContent.aspx?loc=143&amp;subloc=1&amp;menuId=242&amp;mc=1431">New Seasons' Pacific Village chicken</a> is not pasture-fed -- you can tell by the photos on their Web site. Do you know of a brand or a local store that carries pasture-fed chicken?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>One of the wonderful organizations we learned about on our last <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler</a> class field trip was Community Warehouse. <a href="http://www.communitywarehouse.org/">Community Warehouse</a> is a non-profit that accepts donated household furniture and goods (such as linens, plates, cookware, etc.). They work with social service agencies and will provide a referred low-income family with everything they need to set up their household -- free of charge. Their clients typically include women escaping domestic violence, families who have been homeless, migrants and refugees, the elderly, and people with physical and mental disabilities. These folks sometimes can't afford thrift-store prices for even the basics. One of the really cool things about Community Warehouse is that all of the stuff you donate stays local (you can't ensure that about what you donate to some of the bigger thrift stores like Goodwill). And do note a key difference: Goodwill and other thrifts are <em>selling</em> your old stuff. Community Warehouse is <em><u>giving it away</u></em> to families who are in great need. </p>
<p>Anyway, that's the background. Do you think you'll be hungry for some barbecue this weekend? Well, you're in luck. <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/dynamicContent.aspx?loc=335&amp;subloc=1&amp;menuId=542&amp;mc=3351">New Seasons is hosting a benefit barbecue for Community Warehouse</a>. Six bucks will get you a Hebrew National hot dog or veggie dog on a New Seasons bun, served with a bag of chips, pickle, a brownie and a beverage. Yummy! It's from 11am to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday, May 19-20 at all New Seasons locations. Master Recyclers will be there too - so come on out for some good eatin' and meetin' of some cool hard-working Master Recycler volunteers.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>You know that expression &quot;why would you buy the cow if you can get the milk for free?&quot; It's been on my mind lately. I really don't want anything for free. But I'm thinking of buying a milk cow. My kids drink enough of the stuff! The other thing is that alll these enviro-baby steps have led me to be wary of the standard milk containers. I guess I had been fairly ignorant about plastics, so sometimes I buy the big plastic gallons of milk. Sometimes the half-gallon waxed cardboard &quot;gabled boxes&quot; (as we call them in the <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler class</a>). But now I've learned that the gabled boxes aren't so great to recycle. Most Metro area haulers still take them, but it's questionable if they are really getting recycled. </p>
<p>Our new friend Julie recently mentioned that you can buy non-homogenized organic milk in glass bottles from <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/">New Seasons</a>, but it's such a popular item that it is quickly sold out.</p>
<p>I know we had a comment on a local company that delivers milk, but can't for the life of me find it right now (and time is limited since my little one is napping as I type). Are there any dairy CSAs out there? We'd love to hear about them. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>One of the conversations in our recent <a href="../../2007/04/some_nuggets_fr/">GreenGroup meeting</a> was about buying local food. Several of us are fans of <a href="http://www.bobsredmill.com/">Bob's Red Mill</a> products (I personally love the steel-cut oats, 10-grain pancake and waffle mix, and the whole wheat flour). We love that Milwaukie-based Bob's mills a huge variety of grains locally, and were wondering where the grains come from. They very quickly and kindly replied to my email. Here's where their grains come from (if you are curious, like we were):</p>
<p><strong>Oregon, Washington and Idaho</strong></p>
<ul><li>Soft White Wheat (Washington and Oregon (some))</li>
<li>Hard Red Wheat (not a lot)</li>
<li>Spelt (Washington)</li>
<li>Barley, Pearled (Washington)</li>

<li>Hazelnuts (Oregon)</li></ul>
<p><strong>USA and Canada</strong></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>How do I love thee <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/html/">Burgerville</a>? Let me count the ways.<br/>I love thee for thy committment to sustainable food, both local and fresh<br/>I love thee for thy killer turkey burger and cage-free egss.<br/>My heart yearns for thy seasonal treats like strawberry shortcake,<br/>chocolate hazelnut smoothies and Walla Walla onion rings.<br/>My soul is at peace with thy kid's meal prizes:<br/>trowels and seed packets, wind power reuseable stickers, bug coloring books!<br/>My only grief is that sometimes my kids enjoy playing with the balloons<br/>rather than eating their delicious meals, but alas, who cares?<br/>I love thee in too many ways to count! <br/>I shall love thee next time in prose as clearly I am no poet.</p>
<p>(Apologies to the memory and work of <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/literature/elizabethbarrettbrowning/poems/sonnetsfromtheportuguese/howdoilovetheeletmecounttheways.html">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>).</p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Dark-All-American/dp/0060938455">Fast Food Nation</a> a few years back, we started calling all the fast-food burger joints &quot;pooh-pooh burger.&quot; I wanted to make sure my kids understood never to eat there. They remember that nickname; it's catchy. While we don't eat a lot of burgers and fries, Burgerville has sure given us a tasty alternative to pooh-pooh burger. I was thinking about Burgerville while gardening today -- we really enjoy the little trowels and rakes they provided in their kids meals last summer. What practical, fun prizes! </p>
<p>Well, I could go on and on about Burgerville. But I won't. Because that'll make me hungry. And I promise not to foist any lame poetry on you again anytime soon.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/03/shades_of_green/">Shades of green and the chicken of doom</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I find myself surrounded by <a href="http://knittinmom.blogspot.com/2007/03/oh-ducks.html">online</a> and <a href="../../2007/03/greengroup_325_/">offline</a> discussions about chickens lately. That's a little terrifying for me, and I'd like to explain.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, growing up in the Chicago suburbs, my folks liked to send me and my brother to visit <a href="http://www.columbus.in.us/listings/index.cfm?action=displayListing&amp;listingID=4601&amp;catID=347&amp;subCatID=3108&amp;startrange=All&amp;endrange=All&amp;substart=M&amp;subend=S&amp;notify=1&amp;ShowTab=0">relatives who owned a farm and produce market in Columbus, Indiana</a>. Ostensibly, it was to let us chew on a little hay and learn about the circle of pastoral life. In reality, I think they were just happy to be rid of us for a few weeks each summer while Uncle Bill and Aunt Shirley filled us up with as much corn on the cob, ribs and black-eyed peas as humanly possible. Except for the effect the grub had on my LDLs, that's not the terrifying part yet. </p>
<p>One day I was hanging out with some of the local teenagers who worked at the produce stand. They were teasing an old rooster named Mort who was strutting around. I had no experience with chickens, but didn't feel it was right to tease him. I tried to get them to stop. I must have been about 7 years old. They didn't stop, and Mort got mad. Ironically, he chose to vent his frustrations on me (probably because I was the smallest).&nbsp; He started pecking after me, and I ran like the devil was on my tail. That rooster chased me around the farmhouse, and Aunt Shirley intervened by the time I'd looped the house once and ran screaming up to the front door. Aunt Shirley was not to be messed with. She told Mort to leave me alone, but not before he pecked on my knees and bloodied me up a bit. Needless to say, I was scarred both physically and mentally by the experience, young suburban girl that I was. It wasn't until I got to university that I learned the word &quot;mort&quot; means &quot;death&quot; in Latin. </p>
<p>So the whole idea of chickens is just beyond me. And apologies for this rambling post, but my point is it's ok if it's beyond you too. If you feel like switching to waxed baggies from plastic is about all you can handle right now, then more power to you -- that's OK! We are all at different stages -- various shades of green -- and all of them are good. Remember to take baby steps. Do what you can, and don't get overwhelmed by things that just don't seem feasible to you. Even though Heather, others in my GreenGroup and lots of new online friends may be harvesting their own eggs soon, let me tell ya', I don't think I'll be getting chickens anytime ever! </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/03/a_funny_thing_h/">A local food conspiracy? Or just dumb luck?</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Four things happened last Sunday that radically changed my mindset about locally-grown foods. It almost felt like a conspiracy the way it all came together. </p>
<p>1. At the <a href="http://www.hillsdalefarmersmarket.com/">Hillsdale Winter Famers' Market</a> I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.edibleportland.com/">Edible Portland</a>, a gorgeous magazine <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=155,height=134,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/03/16/edibleportland_2.jpg"></a>that<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=155,height=134,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/03/16/edibleportland.jpg"></a>&nbsp; celebrates the bounty of fresh foods produced in the area. Short articles focusing on Spring recipes (finally, an explanation of the mysterious fava bean!) and cooking techniques, interviews with farmers -- it gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling about how lucky we are to live in a region chock-full of good food. The magazine is FREE, but it goes fast. You can find it <a href="http://www.edibleportland.com/pages/advertisers.htm">here</a> or via subscription (it's worth it).</p>
<p>2. Later in the day I came upon <a href="http://www.truecostoffood.org/truecostoffood/">this online video produced by the Sierra Club</a> about the 'true' cost of food when it is grown on a factory-type farm and shipped thousands of miles. I don't know what it was (maybe the threatening, gnarly old woman-narrator) but it made me feel sick about the state of conventional farming. (I had to watch the low-resolution video because the high-res kept freezing midway through.) </p>
<p>3. The video affected me so much that I picked up the phone and called Renee. At the market I'd mindlessly grabbed a flyer for a local farm's <a href="http://www.pacsac.org/">Community Supported Agriculture</a> (CSA) program and was now pouring over it. Would she like to split a box of fresh, organic, locally-grown produce with me once a week? Yes. </p>
<p>4. New Seasons had just become a site sponsor over at <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/">ReadySetMom.com</a>, so I thought I'd check out their new <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/">online shopping</a>. New Seasons is a huge supporter of locally-grown foods, and I filled my cart with products from regional farms. You can read my full shopping review <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/03/trying_out_onli.html">here</a>. Suffice it to say, it was a great experience, I think I'm going to save money on groceries, and support a great business.</p>
<p>I don't think it's possible to exclusively buy locally-grown food, but it seems that we have the good fortune to have so much selection in so many places. What do you think? Do you enjoy shopping at farmers' markets? Is buying local foods something you'd like to do more of, or do you feel that it's too expensive or too time-consuming to shop for it?</p>
