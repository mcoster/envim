                                <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20134803517e2970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Hiking-girls" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20134803517e2970c " src="../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20134803517e2970c-320wi.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;"/></a> On Sunday, the sun was shining so we plopped the cushions from our lawn chairs on the grass out front, and just sat around reading and soaking up the rays. While I don&#39;t want to sound all freaky about this, that afternoon I felt like we were living out our family brand. We are the family that plays together: bikes, hikes, gardens, reads, plays cut-throat Uno and Blokus. Other times, it&#39;s like we are a different family. We zone out: each of the kids on their own computers, visiting Learning.com or PBSKids, my husband off watching the Blazers, and me trying to finish that last bit of Jamie Oliver&#39;s Food Revolution that I&#39;d recorded. I feel uncomfortable when we&#39;re all in our own separate media words. I&#39;m usually the one that sets the limits and makes sure we all log out before our brains turn to mush.<br/><br/>After partaking of our weekend media time, the kids almost invariably ask: What can we do? These immensely creative kids who invent games like there&#39;s no tomorrow, suddenly are lacking creativity and drive after being entertained by the bells and whistles of the Web. This doesn&#39;t surprise me. It fuels my desire to limit their exposure on those rainy, tired days when it seems OK to veg out for a bit. <br/><br/>We live in a media rich world, and I don&#39;t want to entirely remove my kids from those influences. Yet it&#39;s often surprising how their media knowledge makes itself known. <br/><ul>
<li>After reading aloud the umpteenth &#39;A to Z Mystery&#39; to my 5-year-old, I read the author&#39;s note who said he loves to get mail from his readers with story suggestions, then was rather stunned when my oldest said: &#39;Can&#39;t we just email him instead?&#39; </li>
<li>I was equally surprised when my oldest said to my youngest one day, &#39;Hey, let&#39;s go check out bottom.com!&#39; It was a joke. The site doesn&#39;t exist, but if it did, it&#39;d prominently feature potty-humor that appeals to grade schoolers. </li>
<li>Both my kids are expert on the monkey bars, and my oldest at the hula-hoop -- two skills I wished I could master, but never did. Back in the 70s, a cousin of mine once described a visit with me and my brother as somewhat lacking: &#39;All they ever do is watch TV and eat cornflakes.&#39; Ouch! Not surprising then that I never found the time or energy to hoop or monkey successfully. </li>
<li>Earlier in the school year, a 5-year old kid came over for a playdate after school, but kept asking if they could watch a show. Don&#39;t get me wrong. This is a nice kid, who seemed at a total loss how to just play. Gosh, it made me sad. Is there a connection between kids having too much media exposure and <a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/themombeat/2010/04/playworks_sets_up_its_recess_c.html">schools hiring recess coaches</a>?</li>
<li>Kids need to learn the distinction between playing on the computer, vs. real work that is computer-based. When we discussed screen-free week, they wanted to know if my husband was going to be screen-free at work. That&#39;s different. And I pay the bills online, etc. But watching basketball and checking the infernal Facebook -- we as role models probably want to tone that stuff down this week. And we&#39;d be fools if we think we can trick our kids in this regard -- as to what is real work and what is play.</li>
</ul>
If there&#39;s anything that seems to have really resonated this week, it&#39;s the price we pay as media consuming or abstaining role-models. It isn&#39;t easy to find the balance, but moderation is key. I was pleased to learn that the First Family limits their kids&#39; media exposure to just the weekends. Strength in numbers, right? <br/><br/>What are the surprises you&#39;ve found from media exposure and media limitation?

		<div class="entry-content">
                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20133ecf78f2b970b-pi" style="float: right;"></a> If you asked my kids today, they&#39;d deny ever having had any infatuation with Elmo. Or Clifford the Big Red Dog. Or Dora the Explorer. Any of those preschool-age animated media titans. But they&#39;d be lying. There was a time when they&#39;d practically beg to watch a show, and I&#39;d willingly oblige. If the experts said young kids should watch <a href="http://www.aap.org/publiced/BR_TV.htm">no more than 2 hours a day</a>, mine would get their full 120 minutes before I switched off the boob tube. Hey -- I watched Mr. Rogers, Zoom, Scooby-Doo, and the Electric Company as a kid -- and I turned out OK, right?! It was easy to justify.<br/><br/>But like many parenting decisions, choosing to let my kids become couch potatoes for two hours a day was a slippery slope. I needed it. They needed it. Like a drug. And that media exposure had costs. Why was it that my kids knew all about Chuck E. Cheese, when they&#39;d never been there? I found that two hours could easily be extended with just a small amount of whining. What&#39;s just <em>one more</em> show? Some studies say <a href="http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/children_and_watching_tv">American kids&#39; screen time averages around 3-4 hours per day</a>, while others report it&#39;s as high as<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/healthday/635134.html"> 7.5 hours, 7 days per week</a> thanks to 24-hour cable television offerings, increasing access to the Internet and the prevalence of smart phones. <br/><br/>After attending a powerful presentation several years ago by <a href="http://currey-wilson.com/">local media expert and author Ellen Currey-Wilson</a>, I decided our family needed to get the TV monkey off our backs, and to participate in TV Turnoff Week (also called Screen-Free Week). For us, it was an exercise is going cold turkey, and I pretty much knew we&#39;d never turn back if we could make it through the week alive. I won&#39;t kid you. It wasn&#39;t pretty, but survive we did. And screen time, in essence, got kicked to the corner. Once we broke free of daily screen fix, we agreed that it would only ever be an option on the weekends. And because it&#39;s used so infrequently, my kids don&#39;t often remember to ask if they can watch a show, or play on the computer. Unlike the years when we were Elmo junkies. <br/><br/>I don&#39;t know about you. As a parent, I look at my kids each day as works-in-progress and I see all the behaviors we still need to work on. But the media thing? Limiting screen time at an early age was an important and pivotal parenting decision that we got definitively right. What&#39;s rewarding and also sometimes surprising? That so much is connected to media exposure: a child&#39;s activity level, creativity and imagination, the ability to simply play, self-motivation, the time and desire to participate in nature and be outdoors, how well they sleep, and how well they do at school.<br/><br/>Heather and I feel that<strong> TV Turnoff / Screen-Free Week</strong> is such an important topic, that we will commit this whole week to focusing on it (this is the week our school participates, while many others tie it to Earth Day and may have done it last week). We&#39;ll talk about what our kids do instead of being couch potatoes. We&#39;ll be here to motivate and cheer you on if your family is struggling through a Screen-Free Week right now. We&#39;ll discuss our important job as role models, and the choices we make to limit our time in front of our TVs, computers and phones. <p>It is hard work to break the media habit, but the rewards are huge! Most of all -- we hope you&#39;ll share your triumphs and struggles, as well as the pay-offs and surprises you&#39;ve found. And ultimately, how to live in a media rich world in moderation.</p>
<p>Are you in? Struggling right now? What wisdom do you have to share?</p>

This is their stated goal:</p><blockquote><p>From recycling waste and protecting habitat to driving less and
building green, Metro wants to make it even easier for people to find
information, exchange ideas and take action toward sustainable living at home,

                                OK. Bear with us. Gulp. This is scary. Yet we&#39;ve dived into the deep end of the digital pool. We are now <a href="https://twitter.com/enviromom">tweeting</a> and have our very own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/EnviroMom/70271629875?ref=nf">EnviroMom Facebook page</a>. Please become a fan. Pretty pretty please. With fair-trade sugar on top. As for the Twitter thing, we&#39;ll give it our best shot. I think we might need an English-Twitter translation guide for newbys. Just what in the heck does @ # RT mean, anyway? Something to noodle over this weekend while in our Thanksgiving food comas. Links will live on the right sidebar. Big, big thanks to the folks who are already Twitter followers and Facebook fans!

                                I had the pleasure of talking with <a href="http://parentingunpluggedradio.com/2009/11/03/episode-50-parenting-unplugged-radio/">Todd and Laura Mansfield of Parenting Unplugged Radio yesterday</a>. Parenting Unplugged is an internet radio program that airs daily at 11am Pacific, and lo and behold these folks are Portland-based just like us. In one of those really freaky small-town Portland things, we all live in the same neighborhood but then met via the phone lines over internet radio with no FTF involved. Don&#39;t try to explain that to yer grandma. It even threw my mom for a loop! Todd and Laura talk about everything having to do with parenting, but said the whole green thing was kind of a new topic for them. Although I should mention that they do have a worm bin, so some of this city&#39;s renowned greenness has rubbed off on them already. Give it a listen and check them out if you&#39;re not already a devout fan!

		<div class="entry-content">
                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I have never sent a text or a tweet.</p>
<p>My cell phone seldom rings, and when it does I wonder, &quot;what is that noise?&quot;</p>
<p>I prefer an answering machine to voicemail.</p>
<p>I decided against a new digital videocamera&#0160;with HD&#0160;because it was too crisp and showed every facial flaw. I like a little graininess in my videos.</p>
<p>A GPS system almost destroyed my marriage. &quot;You&#39;re listening to her and not me? I&#39;m looking at the map and I say to turn right!&quot;</p>
<p>I have an iPod, but I couldn&#39;t tell you where it is.</p>
<p>I am a technology Luddite. I am suspicious of most technology and whether it actually brings any benefit to my existence. Some stuff, like this computer and the Interwebs, play a big role in my life. Though at the same time I also feel a slave to it, checking email frequently and engaging in mindless browsing. Then I wonder why <em>I don&#39;t have any time</em> to do other things, like meal planning and exercise. I honestly feel like technology, most of the time,&#0160;is a time suck. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m grateful for it and know that it plays an important role in everyone&#39;s life. And I suppose if you travel a lot for work technology can come in handy. But for me, it&#39;s often a distraction from more meaningful activities like playing with my kids or doing a downward facing dog. </p>
<p>Renee and I have talked about Twitter and whether EnviroMom should be sending out daily tweets. (I find that last sentence absolutely hilarious.) With all of the noise in our lives, is this really something that people need? I seldom&#0160;think to update my Facebook status and now I&#39;m supposed to think of interesting things to share with people every day? These still waters don&#39;t runneth that deep!</p>
<p>So I&#39;m curious -- do you Twitter? Are you a technology Luddite like me or a fingers-of-fury devotee of all things glowing and bleepy? I wonder if this is an age thing (I&#39;m 39)&#0160;and possibly a green thing? (Some of it might be genetic, since last weekend my cousins confirmed that they, too, are <em>challenged</em>.) Do people who work to have a smaller footprint depend less on technology and <em>stuff</em>? (And, oh the irony, the green movement has been mostly driven by the Interweb.)</p>
