                                <p>You'll find me today blogging from a <a href="http://lesschwab.com/">Les Schwab tire center</a> in SW Portland. While typing that first sentence I was invited to join their wireless network. Man, the wireless internet is cool. How did we ever live without it? You can even use <a href="http://www.burgerville.com/">free wi-fi at Burgerville</a> these days (you want some fries with that free wi-fi?)</p>
<p>But, lo, I am not here just for the free wi-fi. I am here for new tires. Apparently with these car things, you need to rotate the tires at regular intervals as well as change the oil and fill the gas tank. Is it any wonder that <a href="../../../2008/05/small-car-cultu/">we have to get rid of my husband's car</a>? This is far too much responsibility for us, given that we are also tasked with raising two fairly needy children, which involves feeding, clothing, basking them with unconditional love, etc. And, we also have a house! Which you might recall isn't high on my list of maintaining as far as cleanliness goes given the <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2008/06/home-schooling.html">dust-bunnies in the bathtub</a>...&nbsp; </p>
<p>Back to the car thing. There's all these maintenance details we can keep on top of to improve fuel efficiency, and in these days of <a href="../../../2008/06/is-the-gas-tank/">4-plus freaking dollars a gallon</a> -- fuel efficiency should be high on any driver's list: </p>
<ul><li>Proper air pressure in tires (as much as I avoid doing anything car related, putting air in the tires is actually not too hard. If I can do it, anyone can...)<br/> </li>
<li>Rotation of tires on a regular basis (oops -- apparently driving 20,000 miles before rotating does not count as <em>regular.)</em> </li>
<li>Change your filters (these are the things they show me all disgusting and nasty every time I get my oil changed.)<br/> </li>
<li>Change your oil (OK. Well at least I get points for this. I do change my oil.)<br/> </li>
<li>Don't be speed racer (Points here too. I'm not a speed demon.)</li></ul>
<p>Others have written with more authority on these <a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/pdxgreen/2008/05/eat_your_greens_hey_leadfoot_g.html">car maintenance/fuel efficiency things</a>. I won't pretend to have some grease monkey alter-ego. When the very nice Les Schwab man asked me what kind of tires I was looking for today, I'm like &quot;round?&quot;</p>
<p>I do have high hopes of becoming a one-car family though. At least we'll have only one car to try and remember to rotate the tires. And there will be two of us to <em>blame</em> if we forget for 20,000 miles next time... And with the responsibility of only one car, maybe we'll actually have time to work on our house a little bit.</p>

                                <p>In a sick way, I'm pretty happy that gasoline now costs around $4 a gallon, that the airlines are poised to nickel-and-dime us to death, and that just about everything is getting exorbitantly expensive due to the inherent fuel costs. In many ways, our culture has been built on this weird illusion that the oil was just going to flow cheaply forever. Now we're paying the piper. We are being forced by our pocket books to make changes. </p>
<p>Wasn't there a time when normal people didn't just fork over their hard earned dollars to fly to distant vacation locales? When you think about it, it's crazy that you can hop on a plane and be halfway around the world in a matter of hours. We don't fly much, but do have plans to vacation across the country in July. We've already bought the plane tickets for that. We also intend to fly to California next November for my in-laws 50th wedding anniversary. Both of these trips are extended family reunions, and I'm glad we'll be able to go. But I also think they may be the last plane trips we take for a good, long while. And maybe that's not such a bad thing. Who knows -- by November, if prices keep going up perhaps we'll take more time but travel by train to California instead.<br/> </p>
<p>Perhaps we will be forced to live more locally. I wish more of my family lived nearby, but wishes aren't fishes... We all make our own choices. I am glad to love the place we live. There's so much to see and do here. I don't think I'll miss vacations in far-flung places. Except for maybe France. I do hope to get back to France at least once before air traveling from here to there becomes totally out of reach.</p>
<p>Anyone else out there feeling just a wee bit happy that gas has become so darned expensive?</p>

                                <p>We have two cars. We're working on having just one car. For 7 years, we survived with only one car. You should have seen us try to wedge that infant carseat into the back of our 2-door hatchback the first time. Oooh boy. That was funny. Pretty much had to turn it vertical and upside down to cram it into the backseat. With a real live baby inside! Ours! It's funny now, terrifying then. But we did make it work for years.</p>
<p>Then we bought a white Subaru. We had two kids. We're AMERICANS for crying out loud. Was 4 doors too much to ask for a family of four? We didn't think so. We got a 4-door wagon. It's small (the Outback Sport) -- about the smallest 4-door Subi you can drive. </p>
<p>Then the bikes and feet became more popular forms of transport in our family. Having made a variety of lifestyle changes, we're now feeling optimistic that one car would once again be enough for our family. My husband <a href="../../../2008/05/reuse-rubber-ba/">commutes strong on his bike</a> nearly every work day. Me and the kids are going into walking and biking season: our goal is to <a href="../../../2008/04/lessening-your/">walk or bike all trips that are within 1 mile of our house</a>. Now that we'll soon be out of our school routine, the time constraints will no longer provide that convenient excuse/crutch. </p>
<p>As you can imagine my husband's old red car might be feeling a bit left out of the fun right about now. Neglected. Passed over. Dusty. Wall-flower. Simply taking up space in the garage that might better serve our growing fleet of bikes. So a few changes are in order:</p>
<ul><li>We'll need a bike rack for the Subaru. Up til now, the red car had the bike rack. And of course the bike rack we have won't fit on the white car. Life is so complicated.</li>
<li>We'll need to sell the red car. </li>
<li>We'll need to figure out how in the world we'll manage to pack our stuff into a tiny white car for the times when it's all we'll have. Even now, it's pretty cramped quarters when we try to wedge a grandparent between the car seats in the back (it's a lucky thing they're all slim). Or camping trips... You pretty much can't fit an extra bag of marshmallows by the time we pack our tent, cooler, sleeping bags and pillows.</li></ul>
<p>So how do people who live in cultures that drive small cars do it? Those crazy Smart cars, Twingos and other tiny vehicles that are dreams to park. Do these people just not camp? Do they rent when they need a bigger cargo space? Anyone have any insight?</p>

                                <p>One year there was a parent at our preschool who used to pull her SUV right up to the front door and keep it running while she dropped off her child, sometimes spending ten minutes inside getting him settled and talking to the teacher. It drove me absolutely insane. When our preschool decided to pursue the <a href="http://www.oeconline.org/kidshealth/ehcc/">Eco-Healthy Childcare qualification</a> this year, the 'no idling' rule was on the list of qualifiers, and we've so far been successful educating our current families about the hazards of idling. The <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/">Portland Department of Transportation</a> has put together a great list of reasons to turn off your car:</p><blockquote><p>All of us have idled our vehicles while waiting to pick up kids from school, waiting at the drive-up window, or waiting for a bridge. Part of the reason is that when we were just beginning to drive, the mindset was that it’s better to leave the car running rather than turn it on and off. </p>
<p>Well, maybe that was true then, but it’s certainly not true now. As a matter of fact, <strong>it’s actually better for your vehicle to turn it off if it’s going to be idling for more than 10 seconds. </strong></p>
<p>This fact leads to the top ten reasons to turn off your vehicle when you’re not moving:</p>
<ol><li>Studies have shown a direct link between contaminants in vehicle emissions and significant respiratory health effects. </li>
<li>Vehicle exhaust is the leading source of toxic air pollution in Oregon. </li>
<li>Excessive idling can be hard on your engine. Because it isn’t working at peak operating temperature, fuel doesn’t undergo complete combustion, leaving spark plugs dirty, which can increase fuel consumption by 4 to 5%. Also, the engine oil becomes contaminated by idling. </li>
<li>According to Ford and the Auto Alliance, vehicles produced after the mid-‘80s don’t require additional time to heat a “cold engine.” The best way to warm up your vehicle is to drive it, even in cold weather. </li>
<li>Besides, idling warms only the engine, not the wheel bearings, steering, suspension, transmission, and tires. These parts warm up when the vehicle is driven. </li>
<li>Frequent restarting has little impact on engine parts such as the battery and starter motor. The wear on components that restarting the engine causes adds about $10 a year to your costs. This is money that you’ll likely recover several times over in fuel savings from reduced idling. </li>
<li>More than 10 seconds of idling uses more fuel than restarting the engine. </li>
<li>Toxic air pollutants account for an additional 700 cases of cancer for every million residents. </li>
<li>Children breathe 50% more air per pound than adults, and their asthma symptoms increase as a result of car exhaust. </li>
<li>When you idle you get 0 miles per gallon.</li></ol></blockquote>

                                <p>Thank you, Betty, for letting us know about <a href="http://www.worldcarfree.net/wcfd/">World Car Free Day</a> on September 22 (today! sorry for the late notice). Here's some info from their site:</p><blockquote><p>Every September 22, people from around the world get together in the streets, intersections, and neighbourhood blocks to remind the world that we don't have to accept our car-dominated society.</p>
<p>2007 should be no different.</p>
<p>But we do not want just one day of celebration and then a return to &quot;normal&quot; life. When people get out of their cars, they should stay out of their cars. It is up to us, it is up to our cities, and our governments to help create permanent change to benefit pedestrians, cyclists, and other people who do not drive cars.</p>
<p>Let World Carfree Day be a showcase for just how our cities might look like, feel like, and sound like without cars…365 days a year.</p>
<p>As the climate heats up, World Carfree Day is the perfect time to take the heat off the planet, and put it on city planners and politicians to give priority to cycling, walking and public transport, instead of to the automobile.</p></blockquote><p>I like the tie-in to not returning to &quot;normal&quot; car-addicted life. Just last week, the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/portland_news/1189988714102980.xml&amp;coll=7&amp;thispage=1">Oregonian ran an article about families who are living car-free</a>. Proves it can be done here in Stumptown...</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I should be thinking bike thoughts, but instead I'm dwelling on the perfect eco-friendly car for our family. Not that we need a new car, but sometimes it's nice to escape to that place in my brain where anything is possible. I visit there frequently. My neighbors, who have three kids, just bought a brand new <a href="http://www.lexus.com/hybriddrive/index.html">Lexus SUV hybrid</a> (26 hwy/24 city) as a family car and a Mini Cooper S convertible (32 hwy/22 city) as a commuter car in an effort to get better gas mileage and cut down on emissions. Those stats are okay (and about what my family's cars are getting), but not great. So I've been trying to figure out what would be the ideal scenario (beyond living in a village where everything you need is within easy walking distance).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/09/smartcar_2.jpg"><img title="Smartcar_2" height="160" alt="Smartcar_2" src="../../../images/2007/09/09/smartcar_2.jpg" width="200" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> For us, we need a family car and a commuter car. I like the <a href="http://www.smartusa.com/index.aspx">Smart Car</a>, which gets 40-plus mpgs, and think it would be an ideal commuter car. Even better than that though, is the <a href="http://www.zapworld.com/electric-vehicles">Zap Xebra sedan</a> (perhaps without the stripes), a totally electric car. It only goes 40 mph, so it's strictly for around town, but it seats four and only costs $10,500. I think these cars are adorable, but not sure my husband would drive one.<a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/09/xebrasedanstripes_2.jpg"><img title="Xebrasedanstripes_2" height="200" alt="Xebrasedanstripes_2" src="../../../images/2007/09/09/xebrasedanstripes_2.jpg" width="200" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px"/></a> </p>
<p>A larger family car is a little trickier. Have they come out with a hybrid station wagon or mini van yet? I have to confess -- and I never dreamed I would ever admit this -- but I recently drove a mini van, and I loved all the room. Plus, you could carpool (environmentally-friendly, yes?). The <a href="http://www.toyota.com/prius/">Prius</a> might work, but it's still a little small. The Lexus is waaay out of our price range and I don't really want an SUV. I currently drive a VW Passat wagon, and it tells me that I usually get about 25 mpgs in the city, which I guess is okay, but when you compare it to a 46 mpg Prius, it's still kind of sucky.</p>
<p>Have I come to any conclusions? Not really (except maybe I should spend more time on a bike). What is your dream eco-friendly car set-up for your family? Or, are you living it already?</p>

                                <p>My mom has been visiting, and very generously offered to watch the kids for a weekend so my husband and I (the self-appointed Cheap-o-Dad) could celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary. So last weekend was our big trip away. Despite seeking advice from <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2007/02/weekend_getaway.html">ReadySetMom readers on good weekend getaway locales</a>, we ended up not going very far at all. About 12 miles down the road. We drove from Portland to Newberg, OR, which is the starting place of the annual <a href="http://www.vineride.com/">Vineride</a>. Pre-kids, we did a lot of biking. In fabulous far-away places like Tuscany, the south of France, the Netherlands. In the six years since kids, we've probably logged about 12 miles total on our bikes (not counting <a href="../../../2007/07/cheap-o-dad-one/">Cheap-o-Dad's recent bike-to-work commutes</a>). The Vineride organizers very generously leave their maps up on their site. We choose the <a href="http://www.vineride.com/bicycle_course.shtm">35-mile option</a>. Of course, we weren't riding on &quot;ride day,&quot; so it was unsupported and we printed our own Google maps. But it was just gorgeous. We saw lush orchards, vineyards, tree farms, farmland, chickens, and one overly zealous guard dog (who warned us that we really shouldn't be biking on his gravel road in city-slick tires). The sun was shining. The humidity was low. We biked past an old-fashioned swimming hole -- something you never would have seen from a car. We lunched at the fabulous French-inspired <a href="http://www.cuveedining.com/">Cuvee</a> in Carlton (on Bastille Day, no less), and met a very nice couple from Boise who seemed to enjoy bike travel as much as we do.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it ended up being 42+ miles (factoring in one wrong turn and one detour). Killer noodle legs at the end of the day, and I nearly told off a cow (yes, as in bovine) to mind her own beeswax as I huffed up the last painful hill into Newberg on granny gear. My point (if there is one) is that like <a href="../../../2007/07/a-big-box-o-roc/">Heather wrote since reading <em>Last Child in the Woods</em></a>, there really is a world of wonder just in our own backyard. And if you venture a little further, like, say 12 miles, it's kind of like being in Tuscany (but with lots more pickup trucks and far too many big gulp cups discarded by the side of the road). We never actually made it to any wineries. They all seemed to be atop large hills. But it was lovely. To get a taste of non-city life in a way that I don't on a daily basis. Can't recommend it highly enough. And since we didn't drive very far, Cheap-o-Dad is still on track to not fill up his gas tank all summer! </p>
