            <p>Birthday parties are a highlight of childhood, but in the past 20 years parties for children have turned into big, waste-producing extravaganzas! You've been invited to those parties, haven't you? (And maybe thrown one?) A child will have a memorable birthday party if you put the emphasis on <em>having fun with friends</em> rather than <em>getting gifts and goodies</em>. Whether you throw a party in your home or at a destination, you can take steps to eliminate wasteful excess and set a healthy example for your child and their friends. Here are some tips to help you plan your next green birthday party: </p>
<ul><li>Talk to your child about having a no-gift party. Reassure them that they will get presents from family, but that their birthday party with friends will be all about having fun. Who doesn’t like to have fun? </li>
<li>Throw a giving party: instead of gifts, ask guests to bring unwrapped items needed by a local non-profit. Take your child to the non-profit to donate the items so they can experience the fulfillment that comes with helping others.</li>
<li>Throw a swap party: ask guests to bring an unwrapped book from home. Put all of the books in a basket and have the kids draw numbers. The kids take turns picking a ‘new’ book out of the basket. You can do the same with puzzles and art supplies.</li>
<li>Involve your child in the party planning. If having a home party, help your child make traditional games like Pin the Tail on the Donkey, dropping clothespins in a jar or a beanbag toss. </li>
<li>Goody bags filled with cheap, plastic toys are exciting for two minutes and then they are forgotten. Work with your child to organize a craft project that guests can take home in lieu of a goody bag, or choose more useful items like crayons, colored pencils and books. Or just skip the take-home treat — the treat is the party!</li>
<li>Serve food and beverages using durable, reusable dishes, cups, utensils, tablecloths and napkins. If having a ‘destination’ party, tell the facility you’ll be bringing your own. At the end of the party, toss the dirty dishes into a bag or bin, take them home and run them through the dishwasher.</li>
<li>Try to serve homemade food and treats when possible to keep packaging at a minimum. If serving juice, buy it in large jugs and serve it in durable cups rather than buying individual juice boxes. Better yet, just fill up a pitcher of water. The kids will be more interested in the cake!</li></ul>
