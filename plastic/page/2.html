                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val=""/>
                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a8cf0184970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Paper-box" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a8cf0184970b image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a8cf0184970b-800wi.jpg" title="Paper-box"/></a> <br/> We&#39;ve been reading aloud some of the <a href="http://www.beverlycleary.com/characters/henry.html">Beverly Cleary books about Henry Huggins</a> and Scooter McCarthy. I think they&#39;re sweet. In case you don&#39;t remember, Scooter has a paper route. Henry gets to sub for him while Scooter&#39;s on vacation. While I never had a paper route, these books remind me of when I was a kid and the paper always got delivered by some neighborhood kid on a bike and it was rolled up with a rubber band.<br/><br/>Here&#39;s where I go all Andy Rooney on you… Now it&#39;s these darned plastic bags! And it&#39;s not a neighborhood kid. It&#39;s someone with a drivers&#39; license who speeds down your street at about 40 miles per hour tossing the paper in a plastic bag onto your driveway (if you&#39;re lucky), and you never see them because it&#39;s too dark and they&#39;re going too fast. The plastic bags are so worthless and thin that they usually rip on impact and land in a big puddle getting the paper all wet. I put them in my reuse/recycle center where they breed like rabbits (They do! I swear!), threatening to take over my house. I&#39;m not making this up.<br/><br/>I figured I had a few options to reduce the amount of plastic bags coming into my life. I could quit subscribing to the paper and read it online, but refuse to do that:<br/>1) Because I have a degree in journalism and I like reading this paper in paper-form, and I know people who work there, and I want to keep this newspaper in business. Well, I guess I don&#39;t need a #2. That&#39;s the gist of it. (Did I really just say I majored in journalism and can&#39;t make a numbered list with two coherent points? Oy.)<br/><br/>The other option would be to get one of those boxes on my mailbox post so the delivery person could put it in there and then not need the plastic bag. Genius! I contacted the paper&#39;s customer service, and they said they&#39;d have one installed right away. That was last June. Still nothing. So I chatted with a neighbor who just happened to have one of those paper boxes in his garage that he was not using and gave to me. I&#39;ve dragged and dragged and dragged my heels, but finally put the thing up over the past weekend. The delivery person of course has not used or noticed it yet since he/she is too busy flying down our street like an Olympic bobsled competitor. So the last step in this crazy &#39;reduce plastic bag scheme&#39; is the well-worded letter:<br/><blockquote>Dear Newspaper Delivery Person, <br/><br/>I am on your route. I get the daily paper. I now have one of those bright yellow newspaper boxes on my mailbox post. It&#39;s so very bright yellow, I can&#39;t see how you&#39;ve missed it. But you have. For several days now. Please start delivering my paper in that box and <strong>please do not include the plastic bag</strong>. I wouldn&#39;t mind a rubber band, if necessary.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>Renee<br/></blockquote>I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed. I don&#39;t know why I have such low expectations on this front. I think I better reword that letter a bit.

                                When neighboring school Bridlemile threw down the gauntlet to our school and others in the area to wash and collect this week&#39;s styrofoam lunch trays and bring them to the <a href="../../../2010/01/portland-curbside-composting-plus-styrofoam-recycling-news/">recycling event they&#39;re hosting this Saturday</a>, I was surprised that our school got the green light to participate, and shocked myself by volunteering to help wash (quickly followed by screaming inside my head: &#39;Holy cow! What&#39;s wrong with you? You just volunteering to do what??&#39;)<br/><br/><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20128771c1769970c-pi" style="float: right;"></a> After the first two days of washing, pretty much everyone on our school&#39;s green team is convinced this isn&#39;t really sustainable. The hot water necessary to wash the dreaded greasy ranch dressing (give me ketchup any day!) off a stack of 150 foam trays a day. Woe to the first day&#39;s volunteers (count our Heather among them) who operated under the misunderstanding that they had to dry the trays too and used (cringe) paper towels because they didn&#39;t know where the cloth towels were. The back-straining valuable time of a volunteer army leaning over a sprayer-less sink to get the job done. I don&#39;t know how Bridlemile does it every week (but kudos to them). Likely our school will do our best on this week&#39;s experiment/challenge then go back to throwing them away as usual, thankyouverymuch. You gotta pick your battles, right? <br/><br/>Truth be told, the work wasn&#39;t as hard as I thought it would be. I washed solo and brought my iPod and likely embarrassed myself thoroughly by singing out loud to <em>Hope for Haiti Now</em> had anyone near the kitchen overheard my caterwauling. I washed about 150 trays in 40 minutes. I&#39;ve got them bagged and ready for the foam recycling event this Saturday. Would I volunteer to do it again? Um. Don&#39;t think so.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I hate the disposable foam trays. It&#39;s one of those poster child issues. How can a green city like Portland and its biggest school district buy and throw away (hold onto your hat, here) 3.9 million of these trays a year? But all this effort (and water) to wash and recycle styrofoam seems fairly pointless when we should be <a href="../../../2008/07/one-can-a-month/">higher up in the Reduce/Reuse/Recycle hierarchy</a>. Let&#39;s find a way to invest in durable trays (my pick would be stainless steel, if anyone&#39;s interested) and use water/energy efficient dishwashing machines to clean them (not the tree-hugging parents who already volunteer in the classrooms, helping kids read and learn math). Or here&#39;s a crazy thought: kids who eat hot lunch would bring their own stainless steel tray each day, slip it in a waterproof envelope and wash at home. Bring back the next day: no clean tray, no lunch. Sorry. That&#39;s crazy talk. I got carried away. <br/><br/>When I did unplug from my iPod, I had an interesting chat with our school&#39;s custodian, who&#39;d much rather save the money spent on garbage from the voluminous daily milk cartons (that we used to be able to recycle, but now can&#39;t because they have to be rinsed, which we don&#39;t have the manpower for). The foam trays are so light and stackable, that they seem like a non-issue to him. <br/><br/>In any case, <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/news/2611.htm">Portland Public Schools district has recently announced the pilot of durable lunch trays may be expanding from 17 to 68 schools</a>. I hope they pick our school!! But I&#39;m not going to hold my breath since there seems to be issues about not having the water hookup necessary for a dishwasher onsite. <br/><br/>As for the foam tray challenge, the collection event is this Saturday. I&#39;ll let you know how that goes. Now what to do about these dishwater hands...

<p>I have lots of stuff swirling in my head, so it&#39;s time for a brain dump:</p>
<p>*** Let&#39;s start with some love. I am publicly professing my love for <a href="http://www.markbittman.com/" target="_blank">Mark Bittman</a>, food and cookbook writer extraordinaire (I swear this guy is <em>everywhere</em>). I wasn&#39;t really even aware of Bittman until about a year ago (despite owning his <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/enviromom-20/detail/0028631528" target="_blank">Fish</a> book for several years). The man knows his food and he knows how to present it in an accessible, user-friendly fashion that makes me feel like Yes! I can cook this and it will be delicious and&#0160;good for my family! I&#39;ve recently become&#0160;the proud owner (thanks, Mom) of his <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/enviromom-20/detail/0764524836" target="_blank">How to Cook Everything Vegetarian</a> and I love, love, love it. Mmmwah to you, Mr. Bittman.</p>
<p>*** Oh those Swedes! First they&#0160;get us hooked on&#0160;modern particleboard furnishings, and now they&#39;ve gone and started <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/world/europe/23degrees.html" target="_blank">labeling food with carbon dioxide emissions</a>! This information is supposed to help consumers make more informed choices about the food they buy in grocery stores and restaurants&#0160;-- the lower the carbon rating, the better for the environment.&#0160;The carbon rating&#0160;measures the food&#39;s production -- the type of facility or soil in which it was grown, fuel used by machinery, packaging and transport. Will it work? Well, similarily a<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE59P4O720091026?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=11604" target="_blank"> new study</a> recently found that restaurant nutritional menu labeling, like what we have here in Portland,&#0160;does in fact help people make better food choices.&#0160;So perhaps the Swedish labeling model will work, too. Skål!</p>
<p>*** Finally, here&#39;s some news that will make you want to curl into a fetal position for the rest of the day: <a href="http://www.utne.com/Environment/Home-Canning-Pickles-Peppers-and-a-Dash-of-BPA-5673.aspx" target="_blank">your canning jar lids contain BPA</a>! Excellent. You try and do the right thing and can fresh food for the winter, and little do you know you could be slowly killing your family. Sorry, that&#39;s extreme, but I&#39;m a little emotional (first love, now death!).&#0160;Long-time reader Kristi sent us the above link from Utne Reader (and she just pressure-canned tomatoes for the first time ever). Apparently the only BPA-free canning jars are the lovely, but pricey, <a href="http://www.weckcanning.com/" target="_blank">Weck</a> jars. <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/07/is-there-bpa-in-your-home-canning.php" target="_blank">This article from Treehugger&#0160;indicates that </a><a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/07/is-there-bpa-in-your-home-canning.php" target="_blank"><a>jarred store-bought baby food is also affected</a></a>. I really don&#39;t know what to think about all of this. The BPA stuff is alarming&#0160;and it&#39;s popping up everywhere and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve ingested mass quantities of it my whole life and have fed large doses to my kids. You see? It&#39;s time to assume the position. Wah.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val=""/>
                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Portland, it&#39;s time to face the music: a life without Plastics Round-ups. When the economy tanked it&#0160;did some serious damage to&#0160;the recycled plastics industry; there just hasn&#39;t been as big a demand for the product. The company that took all of that plastic from the Round-ups has had to retool its business and can no longer take such a massive quantity or variety&#0160;of plastic. So, it&#39;s time for us (and everyone!) to take action and work on reducing the amount of plastic in our lives -- particularly plastics that can&#39;t be recycled.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been stockpiling crinkly plastic bags (in hopes that the Round-ups would return), like the kind that tortilla chips, some pastas&#0160;and Bob&#39;s Red Mill pancake mix comes in. These types of bags&#0160;cannot be recycled anywhere in the Portland area (and probably not in most other cities either). They are landfill-bound. This absolutely kills me, because manufacturing plastic is such an energy-intensive, high-emission process, and now I&#39;m just throwing it all away. So here is the perfect incentive to start making better choices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20120a5614364970b-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"></a> </p>
<p><em>(Bob, I love you, but this cannot go on.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s one idea:</strong> Buy pasta in cardboard boxes or in the bulk bins. I know my co-op primarily sells packaged pasta in those crinkly plastic bags, so I&#39;m going to ask them if there are any alternatives. (Sometimes businesses and manufacturers just need to hear from customers to make these little changes.)</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s another: </strong>I&#39;m pretty sure that Bob&#39;s pancake mix is also available in bulk bins at many grocery stores. But here&#39;s a radical thought: what about making your own pancake mix? This&#0160;idea never occurred to me until I discovered the excellent <a href="http://www.foodinjars.com/" target="_blank">Food in Jars</a> blog and Marisa&#39;s tasty-sounding <a href="http://www.foodinjars.com/2009/06/02/homemade-pancake-mix/" target="_blank">pancake mix recipe</a>. I also found <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Homemade-Pancake-Mix/Detail.aspx" target="_blank">another mix recipe on Allrecipes.com</a> that contains more basic ingredients. It would take five minutes to make these mixes. Store them in a sealed&#0160;container&#0160;and create a little label listing the&#0160;amounts of the wet ingredients.&#0160;Easy peasy!</p>
<p>Bang!&#0160;I just&#0160;eliminated two crinkly bags.&#0160;I will not be making my own tortilla chips (that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother level of crazy), but we seem to be consuming less of those anyway.</p>
<p>We stopped buying cold cereal&#0160;a few&#0160;months ago, so those liners aren&#39;t an issue for us. But what about you? Those liners are not recyclable. Can you reduce the amount of cereal you are eating? <a href="../../../2008/09/whats-for-break/">Can you eat something else</a>&#0160;on occasion, like toast or eggs or muffins for breakfast?</p>
<p>What about those silver-colored crinkly goldfish/bunny-cracker bags? Not recyclable. Can you stove-top some popcorn to have on hand for salty snacks? <a href="../../../2009/08/toasted-pumpkin-seeds-and-thoughts-on-the-mediterranean-diet/">Make toasted pumpkin seeds</a> or <a href="../../../2008/08/healthy-snack-r/">soy nuts</a>?</p>
<p>I know it&#39;s hard to change food habits, particularly when it comes to kids. And you don&#39;t need to make allofthesechangesatonce. Nor do you need to completely stop buying bunny crackers cold turkey. But pick one piece of plastic that is headed for the landfill and try to figure out how to eliminate it from your life. Make it a habit and then move on to the next piece.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s brainstorm. What other types of plastic containers or packaging materials would you like to reduce? Do you have any success stories to share? (And darn it, I am going to make yogurt!!! Really!)</p>

Using what science can tell us, it imagines what would happen to our world if humans ceased to exist. It also talks about what the world was like before humans existed, and also examines life with humans, and some of the poor choices we make with large scale consequences. If it sounds kind of gloom and doom, it&#39;s not. It&#39;d oddly hopeful. I&#39;ll probably write more about it once I&#39;ve finished it. At this point, I&#39;d highly recommend it. </p><p>It&#39;s the kind of book that has interesting lessons at every turn of the page. And some shockers. Here&#39;s one...&#0160; Those exfoliating body and facial scrub products that make our skin feel so soft and clean? The majority of the mass produced exfoliating products are not using natural things like ground up pumice stone, apricot pits or loofah bits. Nope. They are using plastic. Can you believe that?! Frankly, I didn&#39;t want to believe it. So I went to the store today, and I looked at ten exfoliating scrub products, and yes-sir-ee-bob. They contain plastic. Read the product labels and you will likely find the following ingredients: micro-fine polyethylene granules, polyethylene spheres or beads, or plain old polyethylene. The only ones I found that didn&#39;t have plastic were from the St. Ives brand, which did have walnut shells or apricot pits, and several that listed all natural ingredients.</p><p>In the chapter titled &#39;Polymers Are Forever,&#39; scientists who study what washes up on seashores and goes into the gullets of sea creatures are discovering increasing amounts of microscopic bits of plastic from exfoliating products:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&#39;They&#39;re selling plastic meant to go right down the drain, into the sewers, into the rivers, right into the ocean. Bite-size pieces of plastic to be swallowed by little sea creatures.&#39; </p><p>Why should we care? Lots of reasons, including that the tiniest sea creatures who eat the plastic are eaten by bigger creatures all the way up the food chain. You are probably aware that <a href="../../../2009/03/environmental-considerations-of-human-waste-good-read-really/">water treatment plants aren&#39;t designed to filter out tiny things like microscopic plastic beads and medicines</a>. I don&#39;t know about you. I am not a plastics abolitionist yet. But I&#39;m considering it. Do you think it&#39;s possible to live life without plastics?</p>

                                <p>We received a good question from a Portland reader:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>We have FINALLY weaned&#0160;our son&#0160;from his beloved Avent bottles, which we had used to wean him off me. Now the question is: What to do with the bottles? I&#39;m pretty sure I can&#39;t just toss them into the recycling bin. But I hate to just throw them out. Can they be recycled? This includes the bottles, the nipple rings, the nipples and the little caps that go over the nipples to protect them. Help!</p></blockquote>
<p>Fear not, gentle reader...the Master Recycler is on the case! Anytime you have something you no longer can use, ask yourself, &quot;How can this be <em>reused</em>?&quot; Reuse is almost always better than recycling because it extends the lifetime of the object and the energy that was required to make it. In the case of baby bottles -- if they are in good condition, donate them to a children&#39;s services organization. In Portland, I&#39;d suggest <a href="http://www.northwestchildrensoutreach.org/index.php" target="_blank">Northwest Children&#39;s Outreach</a> and the <a href="http://www.crn4kids.org/index.html" target="_blank">Children&#39;s Relief Nursery</a>. That includes the bottle, the rings and the bottle caps. Throw away the nipples...they can&#39;t be reused or recycled.</p>
<p>If the bottles are scratched up and junky and can&#39;t be reused, you can recycle them in your curbside bin (in the Portland metro area) if they are at least 6 oz bottles and labeled with a plastic number 1-7. Curbside won&#39;t take any type of bottle smaller than 6 oz, but <a href="http://www.farwestfibers.com/index.html" target="_blank">Far West Fibers</a> <em>will&#0160;accept</em> the smaller bottles. Far West will also accept the hard plastic nipple rings and caps, which should be placed in the Rigid Plastics bin (I called to verify this).</p>
<p>Whew. I&#39;m exhausted from all that sleuthing. I think I need to take next week off.</p>
<p>BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: Renee and I are going to take next week off...so tune in on August 31 for more exciting news from the trash talkin&#39; moms!</p>

<p>Pardon me while I jot down a little to-do list. </p>
<p>1) Work with neighbors to start a collective, like the <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1216/is_6_222/ai_n31976621/" target="_blank">Ainsworth Street Collective</a> featured last month in <a href="http://www.sunset.com/" target="_blank">Sunset Magazine</a>.&#0160;Email the woman you met yesterday who&#39;s part of it. Investigate <a href="http://brightneighbor.com/" target="_blank">Bright Neighbor</a>, a Web site designed to help Portland neighborhoods set up sharing programs.</p>
<p>2)&#0160;Start saving for a&#0160;<a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/07/oregon_opens_the_tap_wider_for.html" target="_blank">gray water&#0160;system as discussed in today&#39;s Oregonian article</a>. Bathroom reno in 1-2 years...hopefully by then gray water systems will be legal in Oregon!</p>
<p>3) Test CFL bulbs in kitchen recessed light fixtures for best light quality. Keep hoping that LED technology will improve so the lights&#0160;aren&#39;t so cold and blue!</p>
<p>4) Sew bulk food bags using monster pile of fabric in laundry room. It can&#39;t be that hard.</p>
<p>5) Fight the plastics industry -- and <a href="http://adage.com/video/article?article_id=137753" target="_blank">their stupid campaign</a>&#0160;to get millenials to think plastic is really cool --&#0160;by buying less plastic. Seriously: make the yogurt and the <a href="../../../2009/01/but-i-dont-want-to-make-my-own-salsa/">salsa</a> already, and take a bread-baking class if you have to. It&#39;s time.</p>
<p>6) Despite your recent&#0160;good hair days, rethink the Pantene Pro-V shampoo. You may look good on the surface, but what is the guilt doing to your inner child? Not to mention the sodium lauryl sulfate? Try the no-poo for a month? Will it make my straight, fine hair limp and greasy? There&#39;s only one way to find out.</p>
<p>7) Sweat more: on the bike, on a hike, at the community center gym, playing kickball at the park. Be a better active role model for your children.</p>
<p>There! Why am I still sitting here?</p>
<p>Feel free to add your to-dos in the comments.&#0160;(It&#0160;will feel good to get them out of your head.)&#0160;And have a glorious weekend!</p>

We have not had to increase our garbage service (yippee!), but our non-curbside recycling center has gone from full to overflowing. We are still quite fortunate to have recycling depots in our areas, where we can bring non-curbside recyclables, but they do not take all the items that the Plastics Roundups did. It makes for a great textbook case of economics -- when the economy was good, we could recycle practically anything, including highly volatile recyclables. Now that the economy is crummy, we are getting a taste of how green moms in less robust recycling markets cope. </p><p>Let&#39;s talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PET_film_%28biaxially_oriented%29">mylar bags</a> specifically. Those shiny silver plasticized coffee, cookie, cracker and chip bags, granola/energy bar and candy wrappers, and let&#39;s not forget the mylar balloons that hold onto helium for almost forever, floating lower each day for what seems like months on end. Currently, there is no place we can recycle mylar film locally, which I was sad to hear from the always informative folks at <a href="http://www.metro-region.org/index.cfm/go/by.web/id=1383">Metro Recycling</a> this week.</p><p>

<p>I have a love/hate relationship with plastic. Oftentimes I&#39;m grateful for its lightweight convenience. My beef with plastic generally comes from the environmental side: the toll that the production of plastic is taking on the planet, as well as the irresponsible disposal of it and its effect on wildlife. (Hello, sea of plastic in our oceans.) I&#39;ve been less concerned about the &#39;toxic&#39; issue -- the leaching and off-gassing. Maybe it&#39;s irresponsible and short-sided to separate the two.&#0160;I&#39;m starting to pay more attention to this issue and I feel like I&#39;m slowly awakening to the fact that I need to be more vigilant about the role plastic plays in my family&#39;s life. Consider this a cry for help.

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20111690ab0c0970c-pi" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="DSCN2220" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d83451c9bc69e20111690ab0c0970c image-full " src="../../../-a/6a00d83451c9bc69e20111690ab0c0970c-800wi.jpg" title="DSCN2220"/></a> A few months ago we started giving our seven-year old daughter an allowance. She gets $4 per week distributed between <a href="../../../2008/10/more-yogurt-cup-re-uses-and---gag---modge-podge/">three piggy banks</a>: $1 to save, $1 to share (donate) and $2 to spend. The idea behind this system is that you teach kids the value of each of these actions -- that you should make thoughtful choices when it comes to money.&#0160;The <em>save</em> and <em>share</em> options are easy: the money goes into the piggy banks and then goes somewhere else, either to a local non-profit or the great, big bank. The <em>spend</em> action is a little trickier. At seven years old my daughter doesn&#39;t really have big buying goals. Because she has hardly ever watched commercial television and seldom has the opportunity to browse the toy aisle at Target, she&#39;s somewhat oblivious to &#39;stuff.&#39; The tricky part is when she goes to a friend&#39;s house and sees all of their stuff, and then she wants that stuff, too. Lately this &#39;stuff&#39; tends to be from the dreaded Littlest Pet Shop by Hasbro.</p>
<p>Now, I am not vehemently anti-plastic. I was looking at my kids toys the other day, and we have a lot of plastic. We didn&#39;t set out to raise them&#0160;on charming, handmade Waldorf toys, and as a result they have been the recipients of lots of plastic. Oh well. BUT. It still&#0160;drives&#0160;me crazy when brand new plastic toys come into our home encased in layers of plastic and wire packaging like the dreaded Littlest Pet Shops. But of course, she MUST have this Magic Motion Kitty pet, which I think is a ridiculous waste of money and just fuels the plastic toy industry. But it&#39;s her money, so shouldn&#39;t she get to decide how to spend it (within reason)?</p>
<p>Part of me thinks --&#0160;let her spend it, and when the excitement of this new toy wears off, then will she have learned a lesson about spending money? Part of me wonders if I shouldn&#39;t be steering her towards more lasting and durable items, like books? Clever girl will tell me, &quot;why would I spend my money on books when I can get them at the library for free?&quot; I don&#39;t actually know what I would steer her toward. Maybe I should come up with some ideas.&#0160;But it feels hypocritical to let my kid buy something that&#0160;I think is an environmental nightmare. I&#39;ve talked to her about the plastic and the packaging, but she&#39;s seven and she just wants the kitty.</p>
<p>What do you do? Do you impose limits on what they can spend their money on based on your personal beliefs? Or do you just let them make their own decisions and hope the world doesn&#39;t go up in flames as a result (she says with tongue firmly in cheek)?</p>
<p>PS:&#0160;As you can see, she bought the kitty.</p>
<p>PPS: Happy Spring!</p>
