					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2008/03/big-green-purse/">"Big Green Purse" book a wealth of important learning</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When the publishers of <a href="http://www.biggreenpurse.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=124&amp;Itemid=44">Diane MacEachern's <em>Big Green Purse</em> book</a> offered me a free copy for review, I jumped at the chance. We've been readers of <a href="http://www.biggreenpurse.com/">Diane's Big Green Purse website and blog</a> for some time, and have been impressed at her wealth of experience in the green-living world. You see, we at EnviroMom are fairly new to this green living stuff, having recently celebrated <a href="../../../2008/03/happy-birthday/">EnviroMom.com's one-year anniversary</a>. If you're a regular reader of our site, you'll know that we are learning as we go, and taking baby steps to greener living when ever possible. So that's where a book like Diane's <em>Big Green Purse</em> is helpful. It filled in a lot of blanks for me. </p>
<p>What's cool to know is that Diane has been living an environmentally friendly life for a long time. She's raised her kids this way (so there's hope that mine will survive all my crazy green initiatives). Her well researched book is the kind of reference book that every green mom should have on her bookshelf. If you stumbled upon green living the way I did, you may have a lot of missing pieces in the puzzle (oh, like meaning to look up what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioxin">dioxin</a> is for that last umpteen months, but never remembering to). This book helped me clear up some of my areas of confusion, and Diane explained things in a way that helped me to understand them (i.e., unlike the very overwhelming wikipedia dioxin link above). Diane's book explores the many ways we women can use our spending power to support and underwrite eco-friendly products -- because 85 cents of every dollar spent is the marketplace is spent by women, as MacEachern explains. She also emphasizes that precycling (i.e., only buying new when you <em>really, really</em> need to) is an important cornerstone of the green life as well. But that when you do buy some thing, <strong>do your homework</strong>. Look beyond the &quot;greenwashing&quot; claims of many marketers and make sure you are buying a product that truly does minimize its impact on the environment (Diane explains a lot of these that are commonly used and very often misleading, even if you are trying to buy responsibly). She divides her chapters in key areas where you can reduce, simplify and go green. For example, she looks at personal products: toothpaste, deodorant, lotions, shampoos, sunscreen, shaving cream, makeup, etc. There's a surprising number of things use women typically buy. She delves into the nasty stuff these products often contain, the unsubstantiated claims the marketers often make in a highly unregulated industry, and then gives practical suggestions on how to find the safest, greenest and fewest products to meet our personal hygiene needs.</p>
<p>I will caution that this is a densely written book -- probably best not read &quot;cover-to-cover&quot; as I read it. If you come at it from the baby-step approach, I suggest you jump in and read when you need, when you need it. I, for example, have documented my <a href="../../../2008/03/sweating-the-sm/">frustrations in trying to find a natural deodorant that works</a>. Diane's book gave me the whole story on all the nasty chemicals and anti-bacterials that standard deodorants contain. So while I don't relish the idea of being stinky, I do see the whole picture better now, and I'm more motivated to find that elusive, non-toxic deodorant that works with my body chemistry!! So this is just one area of the book that motivated me. There's 25 key areas. You'll learn a lot. I promise. Lots of good tips and suggestions for getting yourself to take a real close look at some sacred cows. Her section on transportation and the costs associated with owning and driving cars is tempting me to do an analysis of why we are keeping my husband's car in the garage, when we hardly ever drive it (since he's been bike commuting faithfully for over a year now). </p>
<p>I will stop now. <em>Big Green Purse</em> is a highly informative, well researched and important green living book for women. I learned a lot by reading it, and I think you will to. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>If you are planning to sow seeds indoors before planting them in the garden, you can save yourself a small bundle (and practice reuse) by <a href="http://muddyclogs.blogspot.com/2008/02/newspaper-seed-pots.html">making your own pots from newspaper</a> rather than buying peat pots. I read about this over at the <a href="http://muddyclogs.blogspot.com/">Muddy Clogs</a> blog, which I follow with a combination of awe and envy, where she documents her garden preparation (and recently introduced her new chickens!). She's listed the instructions for making the pots, so I won't repeat them here, but it's such a clever idea. Before she plants the newspaper pots in the ground, she rips the bottoms so the roots can grow. The newspaper decays quickly in the soil. If I were truly industrious that's what I'd be doing on this rainy Sunday, instead of staring out the window wondering if the sun will ever shine again. Sniff. So the rest of you better get busy.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The next <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler</a> Plastics Roundup dates are May 3 and May 17. Here's the details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost
8,800 residents have participated in the past, resulting in more then
90 tons of recycled or reused plastics. Making products from recycled
plastic rather then raw materials saves natural resources, saves
energy, and reduces carbon emissions that cause global warming. Thanks
for doing your part!</p>
<p>
Spring Master Recycler Plastics Roundup will take place on two Saturdays and four locations: </p>
<p>Saturday May 3, 9am - 2 pm at two locations: </p>

<p>What's New:
The
list of accepted plastics in curbside programs expanded in Gresham,
Washington and Clackamas Counties. Portland is waiting until the new
roll cart system is implemented and they will also be accepting the new
plastics. So, <strong>this May will be the last time that these plastics will be accepted in the Master Recycler Plastics Roundups</strong>.
Curbside Plastics (starting this spring with the new roll carts in Portland): </p>
<ul><li>Containers with a neck (like bottles) -- 6-oz. or larger </li>
<li>Margarine or yogurt-type tubs -- 6-oz. or larger </li>
<li>Rigid plant pots -- 4 inches or larger </li>
<li>Buckets -- 5-gallons or smaller </li></ul>
<p><strong>Please
note the two major no-no's</strong> at the Master Recycler Roundups: </p>
<ul><li>Plastics
with metal or electronics inside</li>
<li>Plastics labeled
biodegradable, compostable or PLA. </li></ul>
<p>Examples we have seen at the
Roundups are Fred Meyer organic herbs and spinach and Burgerville cups
for cold drinks. PLA will damage plastics recycling machines and
contaminate the plastic we are trying to recycle. So, please don't take
them to the Roundups. </p>
<p>Please SORT and RINSE plastics ahead of time into the following categories:</p>
<ul><li>
Plastic bags (dry cleaning, store sacks, cereal liners, bubble wrap, Mylar,
six pack rings, tortilla chip bags, freezer bags, zip lock bags, etc.)
</li>
<li>Plant pots and trays (please knock out dirt ahead of time)
</li>
<li>Please rinse and sort plastics with numbers by numbers (bags and pots go in first categories)</li>
<li>Miscellaneous
plastics without numbers: bottle caps, lids, DVD's, CDs, CD cases,
straws, vinyl, lawn/patio furniture, play structures, pet igloos,
laundry baskets, kiddy pools and more. (Bring it, we'll try to take
it.)</li>
<li>Plastic reuse items (good lawn chairs, tables, cat litter buckets and more) </li></ul>
<p>We are sorry we CANNOT accept:
</p>
<ul><li>Styrofoam blocks, peanuts, food trays, or egg cartons.
</li>
<li>Plastic printed compostable, or PLA #7.
</li>
<li>Plastics with a neck (these are accepted in all curbside programs)
</li>
<li>PVC pipe.
</li>
<li>Food-contaminated or dirty plastic.
</li>
<li>Foam or rubber.
</li>
<li>Plastic
with metal or electronics inside (spray bottle nozzles and hand lotion
pumps have metal springs and ball bearings in them) (Small toys may
also have imbedded metal).
</li></ul>
<p>For more information visit <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">www.masterrecycler.org</a>.
Also, remember, most of the plastics we accept can be recycled year round at many local recycling depots. To find out more call Metro's Recycling Information at (503) 234-3000.</p></blockquote>

The magazine is all about 'growing families the natural and organic way.' I'll admit I was really dubious about the content, as I tend to be with most family-oriented magazines. I mean how many different ways can you repeat the same old advice?</p>
<p>But you know, it's really good. The April 2008 issue is devoted to kids' cuisine, and just about every article focuses on nutrition, family meal tips, recipes and inspirational stories about healthy food revolutions in schools around the country. Some of it is information that I've read numerous times before (since I seek it out). And there is nothing wrong with reading it again, since I have the memory retention of a flea (ah, <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2008/03/its-official-ki.html">momnesia</a>). But a lot of it could be really beneficial to parents who want to make healthier choices for their family and need a helping hand. The articles are short and easy on the eyes, and the layout is nice and clean and uncluttered. I loved all of the stories about school food programs in this issue.</p>
<p>There was one feature, however, that really bothered me: The 2008 Kids' Food Awards. The magazine doled out awards to packaged food manufacturers in 15 categories, such as best fruit snacks, cookies, frozen waffles, snack packs and granola bars. Why are they glorifying single-serve milk, juice boxes, yogurt tubes, cracker packs and cheese sticks when there is nothing eco-friendly or healthy about these products? Okay, some contain organic ingredients, but does it really matter when they've been reduced to food-like substances? Maybe it's about capturing advertising dollars, which a print publication must rely on so heavily.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I think it's a really good publication and their mission is obviously a noble one. I'd pick it up again. Have you checked it out? Like it?</p>

I had the pleasure of living in the south of France for one year while I was a college student. I could go on and on about the culture, food and arts of this fine country, but I won't. Today I want to talk about mustard packaging. Look closely at this photo. You may think you are looking at the glass of milk that my daughter didn't finish from breakfast. And you are. But you are also looking at a jar that once held a commercially produced quantity of Dijon mustard that I bought ages ago at a French retailer and grocery store called <a href="http://www.monoprix.fr/">Monoprix</a>. I love Dijon mustard for its spicy kick and ability to clear my sinuses. But I also fell in love with the way it was commonly packaged when I was living in France in 1988. You could buy it in glass jars that look exactly like juice glasses when you remove the label and finish the mustard. There is no screw top. There was no plastic safety seal. The lid was a sort of rubbery cap that popped on and off kind of like the covers for the lenses of a pair of binoculars (hopefully that makes sense -- it's the only thing I can think to compare it to). Now this cup has a design with Native Americans on it (and that is particularly why it is the most popular drinking glass in our home -- the kids fight over who gets this cup daily). </p>
<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/26/dijonsqueezer.jpg"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" src="../../../images/2008/03/26/dijonsqueezer.jpg" title="Dijonsqueezer" alt="Dijonsqueezer" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>Most of the other mustard jars/glasses I bought during my year in France were clear glass, with no designs. I had no plans to have kids when I was 21 and living in France, so buying kid-themed glasses had no appeal for me at the time. They also came in bigger sizes -- short glasses about the same height at the one pictured, but wider -- like a &quot;on-the-rocks&quot; glass. I don't know if regular French people use them as drinking glasses. As I student, my roommate and I did. Sadly, I've broken all the rest of them over the years, and all that remains is this one &quot;Hopis&quot; glass. </p>
<p>I don't recommend that you travel to France to buy a caseload of Dijon to stock your cupboards with mustard-jar glassware. I don't even know if they still package mustard this way in France. But I do think it's important to see that there are better packaging options than how I typically see Dijon mustard packaged in the US. Food for thought.

				<p>For months now the EnviroMom inbox has been peppered with announcements for the <a href="http://www.betterlivingshow.org/">Better Living Show</a> being held at the Portland Expo Center this weekend. This really annoys us, and I had basically tuned it out. Then Renee and I were having coffee one morning last week when I noticed a small poster printed on paper made from elephant poop. It was for the Better Living Show. I was sold! That's all it takes, folks. Walk your talk, support the elephant poop industry, and we'll promote your show. And it does look like a good show.</p>
<p>First, admission is FREE. Yea. Second, there are a ton of presentations, seminars and cooking demos being held all three days. Ed Begley, Jr. will be speaking at 7pm Friday, and the very excellent Shane Endicott of <a href="http://www.rebuildingcenter.org/">The ReBuilding Center</a> will speak Saturday at 4pm. There's a presentation every half-hour on everything from going solar to edible landscaping to pesticide-free parks. Myriad kid activities and music will keep the little ones happy, and sustainable food vendors will help keep you fueled up. Friday noon-9pm; Saturday 11am-9pm; Sunday 11am-5pm.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>If there's any hope for me in the <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/readysetmom/2008/03/its-official-ki.html">momnesia department</a>, it's that my kids will function as the remembering part of my brain for me. They were the ones who helped me remember to bring my reuseable grocery bags when I was forming that habit. They are the ones who remind their Grandpa to put his seatbelt on every time. They really have fantastic memories and <em>never forget a thing</em>: &quot;Mom, do you remember that time when we came to Willamette Park and Maya got a bloody nose and we ate graham crackers and then I used the potty and after that we went home and I had to take a nap but I didn't want to?&quot; Do your kids do this too? I say we need to harness this superior memory power like it is solar energy!</p>
<p>Surely you know how the road to hell is paved with good intentions? For over a <em>year</em> at least, I've been meaning to remember to bring my own reuseable takeout containers on the rare occasion of when we go out to dinner. Do <em>I</em> ever remember? Nooooo. But my kids will. The last time we went out to dinner, something actually made me think about the take-out factor. We went out for Thai. We always come home with leftovers from Thai food. So the kids helped me pack some food storage containers before going to the restaurant. Then they were excited to help me pack the leftovers into the containers! Gosh, did we feel proud. It was like birthing a baby...</p>
<p>Now we've planted a memory seed. The kids will remember to bring the reuseable food containers the next time we go out to eat... Hallelujah. One less thing the EnviroMom has to try to remember...</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2008/03/great-green-bir/">Great green birthday party favors</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Birthday party season is in full swing around here. (It seems a lot of kids have spring birthdays...why is that? Did I miss the memo on spring baby planning?) Anyhoo, my 6-year old has been to a lot of parties lately, and no doubt more are to come. But they've been great parties! Some have been at-home parties with games and crafts, while others have been at near-by rock gyms or gymnastics centers or bowling alleys...lots of fun for this age! What has struck me the most are the simple, eco-friendly party favors that have come home from each party. These are items that are being used and cherished by my daughter long after the party is over, so I wanted to share some of these ideas:</p>
<p><strong><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1066,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/23/partyfavors002.jpg"><img title="Partyfavors002" height="399" alt="Partyfavors002" src="../../../images/2008/03/23/partyfavors002.jpg" width="300" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> Painted flower pot:</strong> I love this! You probably have several of these little pots rolling around your garden shed, and if not, you can pick them up for a song at garage sales. The kids painted the pots and then planted the primroses (which you can buy for about .99 cents). Every day my daughter looks at her flower, tests the soil to see if it needs watering and shows it to anyone who walks through the door. Love it!</p>
<p><a href="../../../2008/01/nearly-a-zero-w/"><strong>Kid-sized cloth napkins</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Renee made these for her daughter's birthday, and I've washed them about a million times because they are constantly used. They get tucked into lunch bags every day or used at dinner time. Other kids (and parents!) think they are really cool, which makes my kids love them even<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/23/partyfavors006.jpg"><img title="Partyfavors006" height="150" alt="Partyfavors006" src="../../../images/2008/03/23/partyfavors006.jpg" width="200" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px"/></a>&nbsp; more. (Yes, my son proudly carries his pink napkin in his lunch box, too.) Remedial sewing skills required.</p>
<p><strong><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/23/partyfavors004.jpg"><img title="Partyfavors004" height="150" alt="Partyfavors004" src="../../../images/2008/03/23/partyfavors004.jpg" width="200" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> Rock book</strong>: This favor was handed out at a party at a rock-climbing gym -- so appropriate. The host also included a tiny bag with a couple pieces of talc. This book gives just the right amount of basic info about rocks -- not overwhelming -- and perfect for the parent who is equally clueless about rocks. It encourages kids to get outside and scout around and notice rocks wherever they go. Both of my kids love this book, titled <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9780064451703-0">Let's Go Rock Collecting by Roma Gans</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1066,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/23/partyfavors003_2.jpg"><img title="Partyfavors003_2" height="266" alt="Partyfavors003_2" src="../../../images/2008/03/23/partyfavors003_2.jpg" width="200" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px"/></a> Colored pencils:</strong> Again, something that will be used and appreciated over and over again. I think a lot of parents want to give out favors that will elicit squeals of excitement, which is what a bagful of plastic trinkets and candy often does. But that excitement is so short-lived and those trinkets quickly forgotten or broken. An item that is durable and longer-lasting might not be as provocative to a six-year old, but they will use it and appreciate it and it will be less likely to end up in a landfill.</p>
<p>We've been to a number of 'no-gift' parties lately, which is just great. But I'm starting to think that the party guests should be sending thank you's to the party host (kind of like you do for a grown-up dinner party). Think about it: you don't have to buy a gift, your child is treated to a fun party (which is often expensive if it's held at a special location), and they come home with a gift. Yes, they are participating in a celebration for the birthday child, but it's a pretty big treat for the guests. What do you think -- a new tradition in the making?</p>
<p>What are some other great green birthday party favors? Have your kids come home with any? Have you given any out? (And for more green birthday party ideas, make sure to check out our <a href="../../../birthdays/index/">Birthday</a> archive.) </p>
