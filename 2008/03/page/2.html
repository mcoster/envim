		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
<p>Next week is spring break here in the Portand Metro area. Leave it to <a href="http://www.scrapaction.org/">SCRAP</a> (in partnership with <a href="http://www.lnpb.org/">Leave No Plastic Behind</a>), those wonderful, artsy masters of reuse to offer a cool workshop for kids focusing on plastic reuse. Here's the scoop:</p>
<ul><li>Leave No Plastic Behind Junior Week at SCRAP</li>
<li>March 25-28, 9am to 12 noon</li>
<li>Ages: 8-14</li>
<li>Cost: $15 per day, or $50 for all 4 days</li>
<li>This workshop will
focus on how to recycle, reuse and reduce plastic, using LNPB's creative
emphasis on plastic art. Kids and teens are invited to

artistic transformation. Activities include a field trip to Portland Metro's
recycling facility, educational games,
mask-making, weaving, and visiting guests to teach a variety of new ways to see
plastic. Junior artists can bring home their creations or display them in
LNPB's third art exhibition in June.

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Portland is still a ways off from having curbside food scrap composting like they do up in Seattle. The last I heard, the company that composts our northern neighbor's scraps, <a href="http://www.cedar-grove.com/">Cedar Grove Composting</a>, was still scouting locations for a facility in Portland. Cedar Grove is hauling food scraps from Portland restaurants and other food services up to its Washington location, but the residential program won't happen until they have a Portland base. So if you aren't composting at home, you are kind of out of luck, eh? Kristi wonders if there is anyone scouting for scraps:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Someday, I would like to tackle composting.&nbsp; Sadly, I feel it's not in my immediate future (i.e. this year).&nbsp; But it doesn't stop me from feeling guilty every time I put a scrap of compostable material into the waste bin. Is there any way I can donate compostable scraps?&nbsp; I could probably even separate them into green and brown...would someone drive by my doorstep and pick them up if I left them out front?&nbsp; There should be some kind of (free!) service for this--it's free starting materials that someone could turn into black gold!!</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Is there a market for food scraps in Portland?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I went through a period where <a href="../../../../2007/05/food_scrap_comp/">food scrap composting</a> seemed like such a huge undertaking. For the past few months I've been using one of the <a href="http://www.metro-region.org/index.cfm/go/by.web/id=557">Earth Machines sold through Metro</a>, and now I wonder why it took me so long. I save my scraps for 3-4 days in a small kitchen composter, then dump them into the Earth Machine along with an equal amount of dead leaves. I'm not even close to filling it up because it breaks down so quickly (even in the cold weather!). Composting our food scraps is one of the main reasons my family was able to reduce our garbage service to once a month. And I'm looking forward to using some of that black gold in the garden this Spring. Good luck, Kristi!</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../../2008/03/home-made-soft/">Home-made soft soap works great as shampoo too</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>File this under: why did it take me so long to try this? Ages ago, I posted a <a href="../../../../2007/09/see-ya-later-so/">home-made, all natural soft soap recipe</a>, which I continue to make and love. You just never know with a blog, but for whatever reason, this ended up being a very popular post. As I mentioned in the original post, this recipe was for home-made shampoo, since I couldn't find one for soft soap. And it's fit the bill just fine as soft soap. </p>
<p>This week, I tried it for the first time as shampoo. Here at EnviroMom we don't test on animals, but we do test on kids -- my own. This time the excuse for procrastination was that I needed to finish the old bottle of shampoo before trying a new one. (You know how that goes. Otherwise the whole bath tub gets taken over by shampoo bottles. I digress...) I shampoo'ed the kids' hair with my three-ingredient soft-soap/shampoo, and I've gotta say, it's great! My 3-year-old has short, baby fine hair that's mostly straight, but usually gets a bit flyaway after shampooing. Not so with my home-made shampoo! It's soft, manageable, not greasy, and really smells good. I washed it last Friday, and it's still clean and sweet smelling. (Today, Heather was shocked at how good she looked when I told her it had been so long since I'd bathed and shampooed this child. But, hey, we sure save a lot on hot water!!) My other daughter has long, thick, curly hair. It also got nice and clean with this shampoo. Her hair tangles easily, so I use conditioner on her (but not my 3-year-old). In any case, I was super pleased with how well my home-made shampoo worked on both my kids' hair. Next, I'll have to try it on me, now that's we've successfully tested it on the kids. </p>
<p>A few caveats: unlike store-bought shampoo, this is very thin and runny, so you need to be careful with the amount when you squeeze it out (I just put it in a reused old shampoo bottle). If your kids or spouse do the shampooing, you may want to warn them that the shampoo comes out fast and is not syrupy like store-bought shampoo. One other thing: shake well before using, since it's not all homogenized, and it may look a little lumpy (this was either a residue from the old shampoo in my reused bottle, or maybe the glycerine glops up a bit). No big deal, but just be forewarned that it doesn't look like regular shampoo. It lathers up quite nicely, but also not as much as regular shampoo. </p>
<p>As I said, the next step is to wash my own hair with it. Like with my <a href="../../../../2008/03/sweating-the-sm/">natural deodorant experiments</a>, sometimes getting the ol' EnviroMom herself to switch is the hardest part. And perhaps, whipping up some natural, home-made conditioner for my lovely-locked older daughter... Does anyone have any recipes to share for home-made, all natural hair conditioner? </p>

He speaks as wonderfully down-to-earth as he writes. The videos are only 10-12 minutes long and can be viewed online, so carve out some time to watch them. The videos were produced by <a href="http://cookingupastory.com/">Cooking up a Story</a>, which is another site you MUST check out...oh, the power of film. </p>

<p>What did we do differently? We used no paper/plastic anything. We used regular kids' plates/cups that I already had, and since I recently <a href="../../../../2008/03/2008-green-reso/">ruled out paper towels</a> in my house, we just used our normal cloth napkins. We also made the game for the kids to play. My husband cut out a couple of circles in a piece of plywood and I attempted to paint train tracks and the &quot;tunnel&quot; to throw bean bags into. I made the bean bags out of fabric that I already had and stuffed them with rice. This game was a huge hit!&nbsp; </p>
<p>We also had a <a href="../../../../2007/09/preparing-for-a/">no gift</a> party at our home. I have to admit that I was a bit nervous about this at first and almost decided not to do it because I didn't want to deny my little ones the joy of opening new presents at their party. I'm over it now and I have to say, the party was even better without gifts! I can't tell you how less stressful it was to not have to sit my 2 year old down to open presents for a half-hour! We had cake and ice cream, played, had a great time and didn't even miss the presents.<br/> </p>
<p>We did note on the invitation that instead of gifts for Dexter, we would be collecting books to donate to the daycare where my kiddos go for a few hours each day. My son got to carry the bag of books into his daycare yesterday and even though he is only 2, he seemed so proud! The best part was, my daughter (who is 4 1/2), said that she can't wait until it is her birthday so she can give something away too! Yay!&nbsp; Now -- that is success!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am so excited to start this new trend in our home! Have you thought about or attempted a no gift/zero waste party? If so, do you collect donations of some sort? Do you have ideas for local charities/places where the kids can actually help deliver what they have collected?&nbsp; </p>

				<p><a href="../../../../enviromom/greengroup-happenings/">GreenGroups</a> are starting to sprout up all over town! Angela wants to get one going in inner SE Portland and has offered to host the first meeting at her home. She writes:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>If anyone else is interested or has started one already I'm ready to start or join a GreenGroup in inner Southeast. I live in the Buckman area, my 9 year old walks to school every day, I bike with my 5 year old in the trailer to preschool in SW then to work in NW, and my husband bikes or rides a motorcycle to work daily in Milwaukie. We're a regular working family trying to make the most responsible choices we can and meeting challenges every step of the way!</p></blockquote><p>Angela is looking for parents who would be free to meet on Wednesday or Thursday evenings or late Sunday afternoons. You can be a brand-new greenie just starting down the carbon neutral path, or someone who is a veteran in eco-friendly living. GreenGroups enable you to talk to parents with shared interests, brainstorm solutions to your green-living challenges and learn about new resources, products and ways of life. No preaching, no judgmental attitudes...just an honest (and fun!) exchange of ideas. If you are interested in joining the Inner SE GreenGroup, email Angela at angela [at] bta4bikes [dot] org. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>When I first started walking down the primrose path to green living, one piece of advice jumped out at me: don't sweat the small stuff. Yet, that's what I literally find myself doing. The deodorant thing. I know it's not just me. <a href="http://www.momgogreen.com/2008/02/deoderant-take-3.html">Mom go Green has struggled to find a natural deodorant that works</a>, but doesn't irritate her skin. Is it vanity? I don't know. But I really couldn't stand it if EnviroMom's motto became: &quot;EnviroMom is so green you can smell them coming!&quot; Yet I fear that's the road I've been on with the natural deodorants I've tried so far. Now I realize everyone's body chemistry is different so what works for you may not work for me. Two cases in point:</p>
<ul><li>Jason Aloe Vera: This deodorant may work for you. For me, it works for about 7 minutes, then goes into nuclear meltdown, and I start to smell like a sailor who has been out to sea, under a hot blazing sun, and hasn't taken a shower for far too long...</li>
<li>Kiss My Face Active Enzyme: This deodorant may work for you. It did not work for me. It's just a good thing they don't call it &quot;Kiss My Armpit.&quot; </li></ul>
<p>Both the above sticks are paraben and aluminum free. That's great. Regrettably, they don't help in the de-stink department for my body chemistry. Sadly, I've reverted back to something along the lines of Secret. I don't stink, but I'm creeped out by the active ingredients in the one I'm using and the Speed Stick or whatever Cheap-o-Dad uses: aluminum chlorohydrate, propylene glycol and triclosan (the key antibacterial in those hand sanitizers I despise so much!!). I'm not sure what to do about the stinky armpit business. Maybe I'll just take a hall pass for now, and hope that I'm not giving myself cancer or killing the earth by using crappy deodorant.</p>
<p>As far as other stinks go (specifically the ones that emanate from children's bottoms after going poop), I have managed to wean our family off those moist flushable wipes that I at one time had placed on our <a href="../../../../2007/04/what_are_your_s/">sacred cow list</a>. We are managing quite handily with pre-moistening (with tap water) a small wad of recycled-content toilet paper for those times when a wet wipe is needed. No need for an extra chemical-laden disposable product and that annoying plastic box that's hard to recycle.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/16/lime.jpg"><img title="Lime" height="134" alt="Lime" src="../../../../images/2008/03/16/lime.jpg" width="200" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px"/></a> I don't know about you, but nothing quenches my thirst like an ice cold bottle of brew playing host to a tangy slice of lime. You might hesitate before stuffing that juicy wedge down the long neck, wondering, &quot;Will I have to somehow pull it out before I can recycle this glass bottle?&quot; (How would one do that, anyhow?) Well, the answer is <em>no worries</em>. When a bottle gets recycled, it is first broken up into a million little pieces, and any contaminants (i.e. our friend the lime) are sifted out. Alas, I'm sure that the bottle recyclers are not then composting those lime wedges, which have probably been pummeled beyond recognition, but in the grand scheme of things, I don't think the eco-Gods will strike you down over a few un-composted lime wedges. So drink heartily, my friends, with no lime-induced worries. Cheers! </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Oh we love it when y'all play the &quot;stump the Master Recyclers&quot; game with us! Diane recently emailed to ask:</p><blockquote><p>I thought I read somewhere about an option to recycle CDs. 
I have many that we’ve used for back-ups or other purposes over the years
and they are now sitting in a pile on my desk.&nbsp; I’d like to do something with
them, other than throw them in the garbage.&nbsp; Any ideas or am I suffering from
wishful thinking?</p></blockquote>
<p>There are at least three local options for recycling CD/DVDs and other digital media in the Portland Metro area:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.freegeek.org/">Free Geek</a> ($1 donation requested for each stack of CDs you bring -- no limit on amount)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.farwestfibers.com/">
Far West Fibers</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.farwestfibers.com/">&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/">Master Recycler Plastics Roundup</a> -- the next ones are in May 3 (two Eastside locations) and May 17 (two Westside locations)</li></ul>
