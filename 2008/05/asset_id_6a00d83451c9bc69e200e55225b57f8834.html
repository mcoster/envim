					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2008/05/how-fair-trade/">How 'fair trade' relates to the environment</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I've been thinking about coffee and wondering if my coffee beans of choice, <a href="http://www.stumptowncoffee.com/">Stumptown</a> Organic Italian Roast, are fairly-traded. Yes, they are! Whew. My sense about the meaning behind 'fair trade' has always been about respect and value. That, say, U.S. coffee roasters have respectful relationships with overseas coffee growers by offering them fair prices for their goods. Most coffee growers live in impoverished areas in Latin America and Africa and work hard to grow their crops. You can imagine how easy it would be for U.S. roasters to offer the lowest price possible for coffee beans, thus perpetuating the cycle of poverty in these areas. But what does this have to do with preserving the environment?</p>
<p>I turned to Beth Sethi's excellent fair trade store, <a href="http://www.shopbambootique.com/">Bambootique</a>, for a little fair trade 101 education. She's written <a href="http://bambootique.wordpress.com/fair-trade-101/">a few easily digestible paragraphs about fair trade</a> on her blog that I encourage you to read. She writes:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Fair trade is not just good for people, it is good for the planet. In order to qualify for fair trade status products must be grown or produced in a way that is environmentally sustainable.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">This doesn't mean that overseas producers have to grow their goods organically (unfortunately). But they do have to follow <a href="../../../content/Downloads/FTCenvironmental.doc">guidelines to minimize the impact on the environment</a>, such as leaving virgin forests intact, minimizing use of chemicals, disposing of water and hazardous waste responsibly, etc. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, you're probably thinking, &quot;Isn't it better for the environment and the US economy to support local producers?&quot; Well, I'm no expert, but my sense is that in some cases, Yes, it is. But coffee and cocoa aren't grown in the U.S., however. And many local producers of clothing and accessories no doubt source their materials overseas. So, I think the answer is complicated. We live in a global economy, and I don't think that's going to change (which is good for us coffee and chocolate lovers). The important thing is to recognize that when you reach for that <a href="http://www.target.com/Square-Pillar-Candle-Orange-Pattern/dp/B000WV4HOW/sr=1-14/qid=1212250947/ref=sr_1_14/601-6522903-2813718?ie=UTF8&amp;index=target&amp;rh=k%3Apillar%20candle&amp;page=1">$8 pillar candle at Target</a>, chances are it was not produced with the respect for people and the environment as the <a href="http://www.shopbambootique.com/store/cylinder-candle-blue-p-63.html">$8 fair trade pillar candle</a>. That's where you can use your dollars to make a difference. </p>

I keep thinking that if I got a really cute, retro apron, like the ones they sell at <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/shopping/">New Seasons</a>, that something magical would happen. My meals would be transformed. The kids, my husband and I would all savor and exclaim about everything's deliciousness: organic, locally grown, balanced nutrition, hand-made, whole foods, all. Cooking wouldn't seem like work! Food would not cost an arm and a leg. Let's keep dreaming, shall we? The dishes would magically clean themselves... So, if anyone can recommend an apron with such magical abilities, <em>please</em> let me know. </p>
<p>Of course, it's not about the apron. It's about not really knowing how to cook. At one point, my mom was a great cook. Then she went the 70s career route (women's lib, remember?) and stopped cooking so much. This was when I was a teenager, so probably a good time for me to learn how to cook. Never really got any cooking lessons beyond how to heat up a frozen Tombstone pizza. My brother and I ate a lot of those for dinner in high school. </p>
<p>Flash forward to my 20s. I lived in my own apartment. Had a job. Subsisted off diet Coke, broccoli, corn flakes, coffee and lite Oreo cookie ice cream. The scariest part of becoming engaged was when I realized cooking <strong><em>meals</em></strong> might actually be involved. We went ahead with the marriage, and I guess I learned enough about cooking to warm my husband's heart. So I have my tried-and-true handful of meals I can make and that my family will eat. But deep in my heart, I know the dread truth: I am not a good cook. And I really don't like to cook.</p>
<p>Regardless I am trying to rely less on convenience foods. I made my own granola the other day. It was good, but not fabulous or anything. One of my kids will eat it; the other, no. I've been on a mission to clear out my freezer, so I made banana bread too (we had some old, black frozen bananas to use up). Instead of using the fool-proof banana bread recipe that I've always used, I tried a new recipe (why? I had no shortening, so I wanted a recipe that used oil instead of shortening and not knowing how to experiment, it didn't occur to me to just sub butter or something for the shortening...). It was AWFUL. Bless my dear husband for eating it this week. With a thick coating of butter and some jam, it was bearable. Thank goodness he needs a carb-loaded breakfast to fuel his bike commutes...</p>
<p>Is there any hope for a 41-year-old EnviroMom who doesn't know how to cook? I've recently had the cook book <em><a href="http://www.feedingfamily.com/">Feeding the Whole Family</a></em> highly recommended to me. How did you learn to cook? From your mom, dad or other relative? Did you take cooking classes? Is it really that hard?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I've always had snake-phobia. Not because of any particular traumatic event, but just because they exist. They could be anywhere. I thought that Portland was pretty snake-proof until our 9-year neighbor brought over a garden snake last summer that he'd caught in his yard. He held it by the tail while it writhed and hissed at him. The young man was fearless, and his fearlessness became contagious for both me and my kids. We got up close and personal with that snake. It pooped on my porch. The kids touched it. It was just a little garden snake, after all.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago while I was attacking the English ivy in our yard, I disrupted another little snake who slowly slithered away. Amazingly, no screams erupted from my body. I was wearing gardening gloves, and I almost bent over and picked it up. Almost. Two days ago a coiled up snake greeted me at the mailbox. I promptly alerted the children and the neighbor boy, and they spent a couple of hours carefully fondling the snake and watching it slither around. Even my squeamish 3-year old son was enamored. My 6-year old daughter now thinks all things slimy and slithery are cool (and apparently rescued a worm on the playground today). I'm proud of them, and of myself, for overcoming our fears of these harmless creatures.</p>
<p>Last summer we camped with a family who introduced us to crawdads. There were tons of them in the lake and my daughter became obsessed with finding them and keeping them in a bucket as temporary pets. I had a hard time picking them up, but she had no fear. I like spending time with people who can disabuse us of the notion that nature is scary (because that seems to be our natural inclination) and teach us how to respect all things in nature. (I'm currently looking for someone who can tamper my fear of sharks. Anyone?) </p>
<p>I think it's great to lose that fear when you're young because it's a lot harder when your older. Even walking through the woods can seem scary because you don't know if there is a bear around the corner or stranger-danger lurking behind a tree. Chances are you are perfectly safe. Learning how to behave when you do encounter a dangerous situation in nature is important because fear alone should not be a reason to stay away from nature and disrespect it. I've learned through wilderness-savvy friends, but there are&nbsp; guided nature walks and hikes and classes that can teach both kids and adults how to appreciate and be comfortable in nature. What's your comfort level? High? Moderate? Need a nature-phobe de-programming?</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2008/05/small-car-cultu/">Small car culture: how do they make it work?</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We have two cars. We're working on having just one car. For 7 years, we survived with only one car. You should have seen us try to wedge that infant carseat into the back of our 2-door hatchback the first time. Oooh boy. That was funny. Pretty much had to turn it vertical and upside down to cram it into the backseat. With a real live baby inside! Ours! It's funny now, terrifying then. But we did make it work for years.</p>
<p>Then we bought a white Subaru. We had two kids. We're AMERICANS for crying out loud. Was 4 doors too much to ask for a family of four? We didn't think so. We got a 4-door wagon. It's small (the Outback Sport) -- about the smallest 4-door Subi you can drive. </p>
<p>Then the bikes and feet became more popular forms of transport in our family. Having made a variety of lifestyle changes, we're now feeling optimistic that one car would once again be enough for our family. My husband <a href="../../../2008/05/reuse-rubber-ba/">commutes strong on his bike</a> nearly every work day. Me and the kids are going into walking and biking season: our goal is to <a href="../../../2008/04/lessening-your/">walk or bike all trips that are within 1 mile of our house</a>. Now that we'll soon be out of our school routine, the time constraints will no longer provide that convenient excuse/crutch. </p>
<p>As you can imagine my husband's old red car might be feeling a bit left out of the fun right about now. Neglected. Passed over. Dusty. Wall-flower. Simply taking up space in the garage that might better serve our growing fleet of bikes. So a few changes are in order:</p>
<ul><li>We'll need a bike rack for the Subaru. Up til now, the red car had the bike rack. And of course the bike rack we have won't fit on the white car. Life is so complicated.</li>
<li>We'll need to sell the red car. </li>
<li>We'll need to figure out how in the world we'll manage to pack our stuff into a tiny white car for the times when it's all we'll have. Even now, it's pretty cramped quarters when we try to wedge a grandparent between the car seats in the back (it's a lucky thing they're all slim). Or camping trips... You pretty much can't fit an extra bag of marshmallows by the time we pack our tent, cooler, sleeping bags and pillows.</li></ul>
<p>So how do people who live in cultures that drive small cars do it? Those crazy Smart cars, Twingos and other tiny vehicles that are dreams to park. Do these people just not camp? Do they rent when they need a bigger cargo space? Anyone have any insight?</p>

				<p>In the grand scheme of the CLIMATE CRISIS (bom, bom, bommmmm) ridding one's legs of stubble barely registers a blip. Many bleeps, perhaps, but no blips. But this morning, after running my disposable pink razor up and down and up and down my legs, knowing that in a week I'd be chucking it in the trash, I started to wonder: perhaps there is a better way? Now, many of you may be in the enviable category of the relatively hairless. Maybe you only need to shave once every week or two. Me? I shaved my legs two hours ago, and I already have 5 o'clock shadow. I have high-maintenance legs, which means I shave often and run through the disposables like a toddler in a toy store. Let's run through the options, shall we?</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>Disposable razors:</strong> Made of plastic, cheap, not recyclable (or are they?) and headed straight for your nearest landfill.</p>
<p><strong>Reusable razor with disposable cartridges:</strong> This is the 'system.' You buy a razor and change out the blades as needed. But it comes at a price: the razor is around $10 and the disposable cartridges around $15 for 8 or so. The cartridges appear to be encased in heavy plastic, but still generate less waste than a disposable.</p>
<p><strong>Electric razors:</strong> I have never tried these but always assumed that an electric razor wouldn't offer a very close shave. They range in price from $15 to $200 and I suspect they don't use much energy to operate.</p>
<p><strong>Waxing:</strong> Again, waxing newby here (and frankly, the scene of Steve Carell getting waxed in the <em>40-Year Old Virgin</em> is exactly how I picture it). But I would imagine that waxing generates a lot of waste, like, er, the wax? They don't reuse it. They have to keep it heated, which generates energy. Plus, it's expensive. But, supposedly you don't have to de-hair your legs as often.</p>
<p><strong>Lasers, electrolysis, etc.:</strong> Ow. Ow. Quit it. Ow.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing!:</strong> I do wish I could just do nothing and let the hair flow where it may. I cannot. Kudos to those of you who do, but I will continue to wage the battle of follicle until I'm nothing but ashes and dust (because apparently hair continues to grow after you die! so just pop me in the oven, please).</p></blockquote><p>Oh, the ponderous decisions! It weighs heavily on my mind and psyche. (Not really.) What is the right thing to do? Or, just tell me what you do!</p>

It's sure a good thing no one was hurting for clean underwear this weekend, because by the time we figured out that Saturday was going to be the only non-rainy day, we'd missed our window for using the <a href="../../../2008/05/summer-clothesl/">solar-powered clothesline</a>. In any case, we did spend some quality family time on our back deck and caught a nice bird show. </p>
<p>Now my husband and I know nothing about birds. We can point out a robin, crow or macaw in a police line-up, but that's about the extent of it. So we've always really enjoyed when these huge, graceful birds come flying over the greenspace behind our house, floating on the air currents high above our heads. We have no idea what they are: hawks? raptors? eagles? blue-finch McCoys? (ok, I made that last one up). </p>
<p>This weekend, they stopped for a visit on our neighbor's roof. They did this funny wing-flapping thing for a while. And we noticed that their heads are red. Out of nowhere, my husband said something about turkey vultures. Which sounded right. We googled it and ended up with a helpful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_Vulture">turkey vulture wikipedia</a> listing. Sounds about right. They are known for wing flapping to dry themselves, not the prettiest of faces, but lovely on the wing. Check, check and check. </p>
<p>Here they are flapping on our neighbor's fine slate roof: <a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/26/flapping.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" alt="Flapping" title="Flapping" src="../../../images/2008/05/26/flapping.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysetmom.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/26/red.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" alt="Red" title="Red" src="../../../images/2008/05/26/red.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"/></a>
And if you look closely enough at this one, you can almost see their red heads: </p>
<p>One thing is for sure; I need a higher power zoom on my camera. </p>

				<p>Do you wear your <a href="http://www.store-laf.org/">yellow Lance Armstrong LiveStrong wrist band</a> religiously? Or perhaps you wear something similar from a school, library or non-profit fundraiser? Those bracelets are everywhere. Leave it to my dear husband, Cheap-o-Dad to take his own spin on the inspirational wrist band.</p>

The other day at work, he took an old rubber band, wrote &quot;Commute Strong&quot; on it, and handed one out to each of his co-workers who join him in bike commuting to work. I nearly busted a gut laughing. Good message. Mine will say &quot;Blog Strong.&quot; And if you turn it over, it says Organic Asparagus, with its PLU code. Gotta love the reuse factor. </p>
<p>Wanna join the bike commute club, but fearful of riding your bike in traffic? The <a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/pdxgreen/pdxgreen_in_print_friday_colum/">Oregonian's Shelby Wood wrote of her cycling fears this week</a>, and linked to some Portland area &quot;Women on Bikes&quot; clinics designed to answer questions and get all us &quot;lady-mamas&quot; (this is what my kids call women) back in the bike saddle. That's where you'll find me this summer. I got a new-to-me used hybrid bike off craigslist a few weeks ago so I can comfortably ride. Sadly (or maybe happily), my mountain biking days seem to be over.</p>
<p>Do you Bike Strong? Commute Strong? Or need to get yourself back in the saddle? What's your best piece of advice for someone recently back in the bike saddle, and if you are fearful of biking -- what can we help you try to work on?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I read a rather alarming study on the <a href="http://www.childrenandnature.org/news/detail/why_do_child_care_centers_keep_kids_inside">Children & Nature Network Web site</a> about the disconnect between day-care centers and outdoor play. The study, which included 34 child-care centers in the Cincinatti area, noted that kids between the ages of three and six in day-care centers aren't getting outdoors enough due to a number of factors including: parents didn't send a warm enough jacket; kids were eating the bark chips (!); teachers didn't want to stand outside in the cold weather; kids wore flip-flops to school. If one child had innapropriate clothing, like flip-flops or no coat, then the entire class had to stay inside. </p>
<p>At my son's preschool they will go out for half an hour (it's only a 3-hour morning program) unless it is raining because there isn't a covered play area. In the winter we send him in rainboots, mittens, hat and warm jacket, and the teachers will take the time to make sure each child is bundled up. </p>
<p>How about your child's day-care center or preschool? Do they get outdoors, even in the cold weather, for some active play? </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Today I walked by a display in Fred Meyer proclaiming: &quot;Little Debbie Snack Treats, 10 for $10!&quot; You can buy an entire box of Oatmeal Creme Pies or Fudge Rounds for only $1!! Can you believe how cheap that is? Why, one of those boxes could feed a child for two or three days! Man I love this country.</p>
<p>I felt a little ill when I saw that display because I know that many people will toss several boxes into their carts and proceed to eat them all over a few days time. Who can resist that wholesome little cowgirl? </p>
<p>As I left the store I watched an extremely obese man try to hoist himself behind the wheel of his Suburban. I felt terrible for him. His obesity could be due to many different factors, and I don't imagine he's happy about the state of his health. I was behind his car as he turned into the Burger King parking lot, which made me even more sad for him.</p>
<p>I wish our society wasn't so rife with junk food. I wish our food culture wasn't based on quick and easy convenience. I wish that more parents would set better examples for their children and take the time to make healthier food choices. Fred Meyer, you and I are going to take a little break from each other. You totally bum me out.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../../2008/05/crocs-the-shoes/">Crocs: the shoes every kid is wearing can be recycled</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Oh I tried so hard not to buy Crocs for my kids. I had several reasons:</p>
<ol><li>I am not a trend-setter or follower, and Crocs just seem so <em>trendy</em>.</li>
<li>I never had Candies sandals when I was a kid, and OH MY GOD I WANTED THEM SO BAD. I don't even remember what they look like now, but I could have died for wanting them. But no luck. My parents doggedly dressed me in clothing from Sears -- perhaps you remember the <a href="http://www.searsarchives.com/brands/toughskins.htm">ultra non-hip ToughSkins brand</a>? That was me. Then it was Tretorns. And somewhere in there those <a href="http://www.drschollsshoes.com/Shopping/ProductDetails.aspx?p=05315&amp;pg=5013792">Dr. Scholl's wooden exercise sandals</a>. By the time I saved up enough babysitting money to buy them, they were hopelessly out of style. </li>
<li>Concerns about being constantly hit up for the Croc bling. Tell me, why do shoes need jewelry?</li></ol>
<p>Do you see how hard it is to be an EnviroMom, people? Buying something new is practically an agony for me every time. In any case, I came full circle. As much as I wished to have the cool shoes as a kid, I never did. Did I really want to do that to my kids too? Nah. So I bought them both a pair of Crocs. I was able to justify the purchase in several ways:</p>
<ul><li>They're kind of like shoes and kind of like clogs and kind of like sandals and kind of like swimshoes. So that's like 4 pairs of shoes in 1!</li>
<li>The size is a range, so hopefully they'll actually wear these for quite some time. </li>
<li>I toyed with the knock-offs, but ultimately got Croc brand. The first pair I picked up were made in the US instead of China. Somehow that made me feel better. The second pair were made in China. So ultimately this point became moot, since all the knock-offs are made in China.</li>
<li>And they just look so dang cute on their feet: like little colorful ventilated Dutch clogs! But not made out of wood. Made out of some mysterious is-it-rubber-is-it-plastic Croc stuff. </li></ul>
<p>Lo and behold, after all this agonizing &quot;to buy or not to buy, that is the question...&quot; I found out that <a href="http://www.solesunited.com/index.html">Crocs can be recycled once the soles wear out</a>. So I'm still not sure if I made the right decision. I'm not sure my kids are LOVING their Crocs in the way I <em>would have</em> LOVED my Candies or Tretorns had I been given the opportunity to grace my feet with them... But I do really like that they can be recycled.&nbsp; </p>
