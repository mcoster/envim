				<p>If there&#39;s one positive thing that&#39;s come out of the lousy economy, it&#39;s that it&#39;s making me think about the holidays and what they mean to our family. Really, the focus thus far has always revolved around Santa and presents, and I&#39;d like that to change. We aren&#39;t religious, so that aspect is out. We&#39;ve&#0160;talked about Christmas being a &#39;time for family&#39; but that&#39;s never really been truly defined.&#0160;So what does it all mean then? I think my husband finally nailed it for us this year: &quot;Peace on Earth, goodwill towards mankind.&quot; Not really original, but it hit home. We are not a disadvantaged family. We&#39;re healthy, we&#39;re comfortable, only one of us needs to work out of the house, and it&#39;s time we really started to give back to our community beyond writing checks. I mean, that&#39;s still good, but it doesn&#39;t have as big an impact on&#0160;our kids.</p>
<p>So Saturday is <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneyhand/familyvolunteers/" target="_blank">Family Volunteer Day</a> (don&#39;t be put off by the Disney connection), and it&#39;s a great time to discover all of the needs and opportunities in your community. Locally, the <a href="http://www.handsonportland.org/AboutUs/index.php/FocusMonth_FamilyNov08.html" target="_blank">Hands On Portland organization has scads of family-oriented volunteer events planned for Saturday</a> as well as throughout the year. One example: this Saturday your family, even the toddlers, can head over to Zenger Farms and help harvest potatoes and weed bioswales and do other clean-up tasks around the farm. Or stay indoors at Hosford Elementary and make cards and love letters to send to sick children across the country.&#0160;Kids six and up can help stock the pantry at the Oregon Food Bank. There is always a need in your community, and maybe this is the time to find one that your family can rally behind and devote some spare time to supporting. </p>
<p>Does your family volunteer in your community? How often, and what do you do?</p>
<p>One last thing: my husband alerted me to this site, <a href="http://charterforcompassion.com/" target="_blank">Charter for Compassion</a>, which is attempting to bring together people from EVERYWHERE, of every religion and belief and persuasion, to create a global caring community. It&#39;s a huge, bold project and I can&#39;t wait to see what happens with it. There is still a little time left to add your ideas to the charter -- 35 hours as of this post.</p>

				<p>I&#39;m a sucker for factoids. This quarter&#39;s water bill from the Portland Water Bureau included this tasty little tidbit:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Did you know that you can drink 748 gallons of Portland&#39;s tap water for only $2.07? <br/></div><p>Right on! Bartender, make mine a double! Of course we all know that bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline. And most bottled water is just tap in a bottle.</p><p>As part of <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/water/index.cfm?c=45214&amp;a=196401">Portland&#39;s &quot;I Only Drink Tap Water&quot; campaign</a>, you can get a bumper sticker or window cling at various water bureau events to support the drive to &quot;drink local.&quot; The best part about drinking from the tap is that you don&#39;t support the bottled water industry, you reduce massive amounts of transportation costs associated with trucking water, and you don&#39;t have to throw away or recycle the mountains of plastic bottles that some Americans seem to love so. I don&#39;t know about you, but I can no longer stand the taste of water in a plastic bottle after having switched to a metal water bottle. </p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last night Renee and I gave a talk on household waste reduction to a local preschool, and it was so much fun. The parents were really into it and asked lots of great questions.&#0160;One parent wondered if you could take a class of kids to tour a Materials Recycling Facility (MRF, pronounced &#39;merf&#39;). MRF&#39;s are nasty places, and most do not allow tours. Big, noisy&#0160;machines, lots of broken glass, and pretty stinky. Renee and I took a tour through the <a href="http://www.masterrecycler.org/" target="_blank">Master Recycler</a> program and it is pretty interesting. Here&#39;s a really good video that gives a great overview of what happens to your recyclables after they leave the curb (click &#39;Explore the Cycle&#39; after the 45 second intro):</p>
<p>(<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Okay, so I had to delete that video because it would play everytime you load EnviroMom. Very annoying. It&#39;s still a good video, just go see it at their <a href="http://www.explorethecycle.com/" target="_blank">site</a> if you&#39;re interested.)</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a video aimed at kids, but the graphics are good and you could pause it and explain what&#39;s happening in your own words. The company that produced this video is <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/" target="_blank">RecycleBank</a>, and they provide incentives for recycling. I can&#39;t decide if I really like this idea or not. You get one of their rollcarts, and a little memory chip records how many pounds of recyclables you put out each week. You get points for pounds, and then you can redeeem those points at businesses like Target, Petco and Rite-Aid. On the one hand, if it encourages more people to recycle responsibly&#0160;it&#39;s good. On the other hand, I would be concerned that a program like this would divert efforts&#0160;from the more&#0160;important acts of&#0160;<em>reducing</em> and <em>reusing</em>. I&#39;m not even sure the city of Portland or other cities would accept an &#39;alternative&#39; rollcart, even though it does look identical to the ones we use. I&#39;d be curious to hear from people who&#39;ve tried it.</p>
<p>PS: Tomorrow is <a href="http://www.nrc-recycle.org/americarecycles.aspx">America Recycles Day</a>!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>We received an absolutely delightful email from Melissa in Massachusetts who with a tiny bit of help from us, started a GreenGroup in Massachusetts:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Just wanted to say a big thanks for the inspiration and
information...we kicked off our neighborhood GreenGroup last night. We
had a decent turnout and will probably even get a few more next time
around (a few people who said they&#39;d be coming had stuff come up and
couldn&#39;t make it). And while we had a sort of outline of what we wanted
to do to get the conversation going, we barely needed it. People
couldn&#39;t wait to share their experiences and questions, and while we
told people to expect the meeting to last about an hour, it went for
closer to two without ever dragging at all! Ideas covered ranged from
low-key (swapping books) to pretty big stuff (uniting to try to
purchase organic lawn care service as a group for a better price). <br/><br/>We&#39;ve
started a Google group to share info online between meetings, and to my
surprise, even though we kind of offered folks the option to push the
date of the next meeting back til January because of the inevitable
holiday insanity, everyone pretty much thought we should book a night
and have as many people as can make it plan on coming. I think that
might have felt like the biggest indicator of the success of the night!<br/><br/>Anyway,
I&#39;m sure you have dozens of e-mails from the people who&#39;ve followed in
your footsteps out your way and started offshoot Green Groups, but I
had to say thanks again for your input and for motivating me to stop
thinking about it and do it!<br/></div><p>Truthfully, we have a ton of people who contact us about GreenGroups. Many of them are interested, but often confused. They fear it will be a major undertaking. They think they need to set up a big ol&#39; blog site like we have. Not so! It&#39;s like a mom&#39;s group or a book club -- only you talk about sustainability. When you want. Where you want. It&#39;s simply about finding support and solidarity in the green movement, and focusing on the very local (i.e., neighborhood level). Do you see a GreenGroup in your future? It is probably the easiest thing we&#39;ve done on our own green journey, and one of the most rewarding. If you are interested in setting up a GreenGroup in your neck of the woods, drop us an email and we&#39;ll help you get started!</p>

				<p>It&#39;s one of those days. A kid home sick. A missing toy meltdown. A giant Halloween candy-induced&#0160;blemish (me). My brain can handle only sound bites today:</p>

Turns out that they contain tasty ingredients like PVC,&#0160;polyurethane and&#0160;formaldehyde. I. Don&#39;t. Get. It. Why is it OK to have any of these ingredients near children in any form?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I&#39;ve been off the train for many hours, and my body still feels like it is swaying. I stick to my original assertion, that<a href="../../../../2008/09/air-travel-no-t/"> traveling with the family via Amtrak train</a> was worth trying <strong>once</strong>. And I still wonder if being in sleeping cars would have made it more enjoyable. Hard to say. It may cost that much more that taking the train would not have been less expensive than flying. Being more environmentally friendly was part of the decision, but cost has to be factored in.</p><p>There were highlights. The kids loved pushing the doors open as we walked from car-to-car. We were seated in the caboose during one leg of the trip and enjoyed watching it snow in the southern Oregon mountains. It was fun to eat in a dining car. The observatory train was quite beautiful as we rambled though California on the first leg of our trip. My six-year-old said it was much more fun that flying simply because the wheelchair-accessible bathrooms were so roomy.</p><p>Naively, I figured taking Amtrak would be similar to the times I took the train while living in France. That jaunt to Barcelona. Several hours on a bullet train between Paris and Marseilles. Among normal, middle-class, well-dressed riders. Efficient, polite conductors. Priority over freight and commuter trains so that we arrived and departed on time. Well, with Amtrak I was wrong on most counts. Highly disillusioning. About the riders. There is a subset of the American population that chooses to take the train, and people, let&#39;s just say that &quot;well-dressed&quot; or &quot;middle-class&quot; probably does not describe them. There are people who stated they are afraid to fly or are just so over the security issues of air travel. There are people who have extensive medical histories encompassing cancers, bypass surgeries, kidney stones, lap-band procedures, adverse reactions to medications and lawsuits -- and who describe each and every point in their medical histories to total strangers ad nauseum while we tried to get our kids to fall asleep. Then there was the senior citizen who threw a hissy fit when we boarded the train home in San Jose at 8:30pm Monday night when she realized that the empty seat next to her was actually going to be taken and that she couldn&#39;t stretch all of her crap over two seats. I kid you not: she started throwing things and swearing (the f-bomb, if you must know) about how she&#39;s &quot;just an old lady on a fixed income and it&#39;s not right and she needs her sleep.&quot; Of course, we got front row seats since one of the members of our party was the lucky someone who was assigned the seat next to her that set off said tantrum. I told her there was no call for profanity and reminded her that I had a child listening to every blessed curse to no avail. My husband went and got the conductors who threatened to throw that old mama off the train if she didn&#39;t hush up. Amazingly, she did. Although it was far from an auspicious start to the last leg of our train adventure, it did lend a wonderful teaching moment for our family. I got great joy in loudly telling my 4-year old how sad it is that some grown-ups never learn how pathetic it looks to fail to outgrow temper tantrums.</p><p>

But what about not having them in the first place? I know -- crazy! I mean, what a big ol&#39; joybuster. Kids need parties, right? It&#39;s all part of the whole childhood experience we&#39;re creating for them. Right? I dunno. My daughter is turning seven in a couple of weeks and it seems like we&#39;ve been talking about her birthday party for a year. Well, actually we have. Every time she attends someone else&#39;s party, <em>that&#39;s</em> the party she wants to have. Bowling, roller skating, bouncy center, movie theater, rock gym, gymnastics center, etc. (Mind you it&#39;s November -- holding it outdoors in the pissing down rain isn&#39;t a great option.) So when it came time to plan her own she had to make some tough decisions. She really didn&#39;t want to have a party at home, as we&#39;d originally planned, she wanted to have it someplace where she could invite a lot of friends. I explained that this type of party, since it would be a lot more expensive, would be her &#39;big&#39; present. </p>
<p>Deep thought ensued.</p>
<p>I could see she was really conflicted about the decision, and I felt bad that I was making it hard for her, but darn it, spending $100-plus on a birthday party just isn&#39;t in the budget. My husband was appalled at the amount. He&#39;d never had a birthday party growing up. I recalled only two parties under the age of 12, and I had two friends at each. I don&#39;t think I suffered as a result. So, I threw out a crazy idea: what if, instead of having a party, we have a mother-daughter adventure day. I&#39;d just heard about this big <a href="http://www.clackamas.us/ncprd/aquatic/" target="_blank">aquatic center</a> where they have these&#0160;crazy slides and a wave pool and a rock-climbing wall. It&#39;s not a place we&#39;d ever go to typically -- it&#39;s truly a destination. She thought it was the perfect idea. It&#39;s all she can talk about now. Daddy will hang with brother while she gets the full-on attention from Mom at a new, exciting place. We&#39;ll have a small family party with cake and presents and the standard at-school celebration, and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how &#39;green&#39; this kind of celebration really is -- we&#39;re driving a ways out and no doubt this kind of aquatic extravaganza is a total energy suck. But what&#39;s cool is that this kid has embraced a different idea of celebration. She&#39;s rejected the norm and is trying something new. I&#39;m thrilled, and it gives me hope that we can continue to experiment with new traditions in our family. Unless she decides the day before that this is a TERRIBLE idea and she really, really needs to have a party, I think this might be the best no-party birthday party ever! (Except for the part about me wearing a bathing suit.)</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A couple of years ago we visited my in-law&#39;s house and I remember feeling quite appalled when my husband explained to me that there was a bucket in the shower/tub of his parents&#39; bathroom to capture the clean, cold water coming out of the faucet before it turns warm enough to shower. I can&#39;t even describe my reaction. It just seemed so cheap and utterly insane. My husband gave me a look that said &quot;You&#39;re telling me?!? This is one of many reasons why I don&#39;t live here anymore!&quot; </p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m a bit chagrined at my original reaction to the shower bucket. Because if you look into my shower, you&#39;ll find one just like it. In the summer, we use this mini reservoir to water outdoors plants. Now in the wetter months, the water is mostly used for cleaning. When we actually remember to bathe the children, we use this water to help fill up the tub.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t foist it on my guests (there&#39;s no bucket in the guest bathroom). Only the master. I also acknowledge that there&#39;s a risk in leaving a water-filled bucket in homes with small children, and only went this route when I felt my kids would not risk drowning themselves in it. </p>
<p>We are heading out of town to<a href="../../../../2008/09/air-travel-no-t/"> visit my in-laws this weekend</a>, and although we won&#39;t be staying at their house, I have a much changed attitude. They&#39;ve always been &quot;savers&quot; so I look forward to the creative ideas we may learn from them on this trip.</p>

<p>In this time of economic uncertainty...</p>
<p>No! I&#39;m not going there today. It seems like everything is blamed on the unsteady economic climate these days. Creating a neighborhood lending library is something we can do during any time frame -- it just makes good green community sense. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted to do for awhile now, and yeah,&#0160;maybe the economy in conjunction with the sense of&#0160;hope we all feel right now has finally pushed me to do it. I guess I feel like a lot of my neighbors would be more receptive of the idea right now. </p>
<p>I live on a street of about 45 houses. It&#39;s a long, narrow, curvy street,&#0160;and when my family walks to the farmer&#39;s market or the library we walk by almost every house on our street. As a result, we know probably half the households. With some we exchange brief pleasantries, with others we have friendships.&#0160;One neighbor recently organized a progressive dinner for our street, so we met more folks and got the sense that people are looking for more community on the street. My vision is to create an online database of stuff that each household would be willing to lend a neighbor: tools, books, movies, expertise, anything. Everyone on the street could login to the database, input the things they have to lend and browse items that other neighbors are offering. Ideally each home could create a profile, listing names, occupations, interests, etc. so that we could get to know each other even better.</p>

 Happily hung over this morning after downing quite a few flutes of Champagne in celebration of president-elect Obama&#39;s victory last night, it&#39;s hard to think of anything besides the election and the renewed hope many of us feel for the future. As The Onion so appropriately puts it, <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/nation_finally_shitty_enough_to">things were finally shitty enough for Americans to overcome the racial barrier</a>. This past week, I worried that the polls were inflated and that victory might not be a slam dunk. It&#39;s hard to believe in the electoral college after the recounts, lawsuits and hanging chad travesty in the 2000 Bush v. Gore election. Yet, I confess to daydreaming in the past week of what the world might have been like had Gore been sworn in as president in 2000. Would we as a nation have taken more action on climate change? Or did his defeat lead to the success of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inconvenient_Truth">An Inconvenient Truth</a> and the greening of much of America? We&#39;ll never really know, will we? It remains to be seen whether Obama will be the green president that we so desperately need. According to a Terrapass article by Alan Stein, <a href="http://www.terrapass.com/blog/posts/new-president-climate-change?utm_source=bronto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=Read%26nbsp%3Bmore&amp;utm_content=renee%40easystreet.com&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletter+11%2F05%2F09">Obama gets it about how our planet is in peril in ways no other American president has, and quotes Michael Pollan</a>. So, here&#39;s to hope...</p>
