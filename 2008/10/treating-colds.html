 	                <div class="entry-body">
 	                        <p>I confess: I've been giving my children over-the-counter cold medications since they were babies, and I really felt like they worked. Particularly the nighttime cough syrups, which seemed to help them sleep better. But now <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=93249">drug makers are saying that children under age four should not be given any OTC cold medicine</a> because it doesn't actually work and can be easily overdosed. I'm pretty sure I also read somewhere that they discourage it for children under age six. OK, I'm fine with that. I have long struggled to align my environmental beliefs with my at-home health practices, which have always tended toward traditional, AMA-approved treatments. It's not that I don't believe in natural medicine, I've just had a really hard time breaking out of my lifelong habits.</p>
<p>So now we're into cold season and I've got a kid with a constant cough that is keeping her awake at night. I've started giving her a couple of teaspoons of honey in the morning and afternoon, which is supposed to ease the cough. I'm keeping her hydrated with water. I try to keep her propped up on pillows at night, but she always rolls over. I'm considering a cool-mist vaporizer, but do you think they actually work? Both warm-air humidifiers and cool-mist vaporizers are supposed to be helpful, though cool-mist is recommended for children due to accidental burning with a warm-air unit. </p>
<p>I really, really want to change my habits, and I assume I'm not alone. Yesterday <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/health/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1223951111174350.xml&amp;coll=7">the Oregonian listed a bunch of ways to treat colds naturally</a>:</p>
<ul><li>The honey suggestion -- one spoonful (though I would not do this at night for fear the sugar would keep them awake).</li>
<li>Lots of fluids -- any fluids they will drink except for orange juice which produces mucous. Chicken soup, too!</li>
<li>Use a humidifier to keep sore throats moistened and break up mucous.</li>
<li>Let older kids suck on lozenges with zinc to soothe throats.</li>
<li>Rinse stuffy noses with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Himalayan-Institute-Original-Neti-Ceramic/dp/B000WJIC3G/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hpc&amp;qid=1224185260&amp;sr=8-1">neti pot</a> of saline water. Now, I do this for myself and I love it, but I have a hard time imagining it working for my 6-year old. She might do OK if I used a dropper.</li>
<li>Fevers below 103 degrees are actually good for you -- it means your body is fighting the infection. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are OK to give a child to make them more comfortable. But call the doc if the fever is over 103.</li>
<li>Feed a cold, starve a fever.</li></ul>
<p>I guess the best thing we can do for them is to comfort them. I'm just always so impatient to 'cure' their cold. They miss school and other activities, not to mention the rest of the family catching their cold. But there is no magic bullet for the common cold; just time, natural treatments and cuddles, right? So they miss school and swimming lessons and soccer practice. Better now when they are young than later when they are older, right? Because each time they get sick they are building up their immunity so that hopefully they won't get sick as often when they're older, right? Can you tell I need some hand-holding here?</p>
<p>What natural treatments have worked for your children? And hey, let's talk about adults, too! What do you do when YOU have a cold? </p>
